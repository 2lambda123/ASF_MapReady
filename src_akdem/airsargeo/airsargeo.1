NAME:           airsargeo -  creates tie point files of SAR image points and
                              corresponding geographic locations  

SYNOPSIS:       airsargeo SARfile DEMfile tiepointFile

	SARfile   	the AIRSAR DEM file with which to generate
		  	a tie point file.
	DEMfile	  	the AIRSAR DEM in LAS format
	tiepointFile	the tie point file containing lat/lon coordinates
			for sample/line positions

DESCRIPTION:
        Creates two output files.  One contains a grid of SAR image point
    (line, sample) coordinates.  The other contains calculated geographic 
    (lat, lon) coordinates.  These files can be used to find a mapping from
    the SAR image coordinates to geographic coordinates using a 2-D planar
    warp mapping.
