    SYNOPSIS:  

 geocode [-p pix] [ [-o|-l] N S E W ]  [-i lat lon nl ns ]
         [-r [-near | -bilinear |-sinc | '-kernel x y' ] ]
         [-background <fill> ]
               in_meta in_img projfile projkey outfile
 
  -p pix   Set output pixel size to pix meters.           
  -r ...   Set the output resampling scheme used. (See remap(1)).
           Default is -near, for nearest-neighbor interpolation.
  -background Set the background (non-image) parts of the output
           image to the value <fill> (default is zero-- black).

        in_meta  input AIRSAR file (with header information)    
        in_img   DEM file ingested from airsarin (.ddr and .img)
        projfile projection definition file name [from projprm]
        projkey  projection key name [as passed to projprm]
        outfile  output LAS 6.0 image (makes .img, .ddr)    
 
 
  Geocode_airsar ingests and projects an AIRSAR DEM into
the given map projection at the given pixel size.
This process is called geocoding. 

    DESCRIPTION: Performs automatic geocoding of AIRSAR files.


    OPTIONS:
        The default is to make an output image just big enough to
    contain the entire geocode input image.  You can change 
    (enlarge or shrink) the output window with the windowing options-
    -l specifies the output window in (decimal degree) latitude and
    longitude; -o specifies the output window in projection coordinates;
    and -i specifies the output image's center point and size.

   -o   Means N S E W are projection coordinates.
    N    Y projection coordinate of top edge
    S    Y projection coordinate of bottom edge
    E    X projection coordinate of right edge
    W    X projection coordinate of left edge

   -l    Means N S are latitude, and E W are longitude:
    N    Latitude of north edge of output
    S    Latitude of south edge of output
    E    Longitude of east edge of output
    W    Longitude of west edge of output

   -i    Means write a nl x ns output image with:
    lat  Latitude of center of output
    lon  Longitude of center of output

 

    EXAMPLES:
      In this example, an AIRSAR image named ts1207_c.demi2 is geocoded to a file called
      ts1207_c_demi2_geo.img.  This image has first been converted to LAS format using
      
             example> geocode_airsar ts1207_c.demi2 ts1207_c utm.proj utm6 ts1207_c_demi2_geo
       
      And a UTM map projection file "utm.proj" has been created using
      
             example> projprm UTM utm6 met utm.proj -z 6

    HARWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:
      A projection file must be created before running this program. Use the
      projprm program to create such a file. See projprm for more details.
