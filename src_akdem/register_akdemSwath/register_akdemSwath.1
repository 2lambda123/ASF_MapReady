NAME: register_lzraw

PURPOSE:
	register_lzraw automates the process of sub-pixel
  registration for ASF Level-Zero Swath data.  This program will take
  this data, cut it into pieces of matching location, and size, SAR process it,
  sub-pixel register it, and make it into an interferogram.

  After running this script, you can generate a DEM with
  tandem_ifm(1), or use the interferogram for your own science.

Usage: 
   register_lzraw
		[-dem <dem_name>]
		[-lat <start_lat> <end_lat>]
		[-line <start_line1> <start_line2> <end_line1> <end_line2>]
		[-g <grid_resolution>]
		[-p [<num_processors>]
		[-f] [-ml] [-r <percent_value>]
		[-nolz2raw | -flywheel | -par ]
		<swath_one> <swath_two> <igram_out>

   <swath_one>  is a level zero swath file
   <swath_two>  is a second level zero swath file
   <igram_out>  is the name of the output interferogram

   [-dem <dem_name>] sepcifies a dem to mask out large bodies of water
   [-lat <start_lat> <end_lat>] specifies a start and end
					latitude to constrian the swath images
   [-line <start_line1> <start_line2> <end_line2> <end_line2>
				     constrains the swaths to the given lines
   [-g <grid_resolution] specifies a grid resolution to pass to
					fico
   [-p [<num_processors>] specifies to use parallel versions of
					programs if possible. If no number of 
					processors is specified 8 are used.
   [-f] passes the -f switch to fico for fft matching.
   [-ml] automatically multi-looks the interferogram.
   [-r <percent_value>] is passed to watermask to determine
					the amount of water in the range that can
					be allowed for correlation.
   [-nolz2raw]  Do not use lz2raw conversion, assumes inputs are APD raw signal files
   [-flywheel]  Use lz2raw_flywheel instead of lz2raw
   [-par]       Use lz2raw_par instead of lz2raw

   register_lzraw will run the Alaska SAR processor
on the two images, line the two images up, cut out 
large bodies of water, then coregister the two 
images using resolve, fico, fit_line, and 
calc_deltas, then re-process the second image so 
that it matches up with (is coregistered with) the 
first. The result will be an inteferogram. After 
this, you can generate a DEM with tandem_ifm.
