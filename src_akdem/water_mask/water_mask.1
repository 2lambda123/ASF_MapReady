NAME:
	water_mask

SYNOPSIS:
	water_mask <DEM> <bound_file> [-r percent -log <file> -quiet]

	<DEM> is a dem of the area that the level zero swath covers.
	<bound_file> is a bound file generated by swath offset.
	[-r percent] is the percentage of land that is required in 
		the range.
	[-log <file>] allows the output to be written to a log file
        [-quiet] suppresses the output to the essential


DESCRIPTION:
	This program masks the water out of an interferogram based on a 
     provided DEM.  This program is not perfect, and does not handle
     all cases.  There will be instances where the offsets may have 
     to be determined by hand.
