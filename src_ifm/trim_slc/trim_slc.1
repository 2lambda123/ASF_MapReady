NAME: trim_slc

SYNOPSIS:
   
     trim_slc <inSLC> <outCPX> <top line> <left samp> [<trim ht> <trim wth>]

DESCRIPTION:

	Trim_slc does two things: it converts a single-look-complex
	format image into a LAS 6.0 float-complex image, and allows you 
	to trim that image.  The DDR's master line and master sample 
	fields ARE maintained.

	You specify the input, output filenames, and 
	a top left coordinate.  Trim_slc will create a new image in outfile
	which starts at these coordinates.  Optionally, you can also
	specify the new height and width of the output image (if not 
	specified, trim will use the old size minus the top left coordinates
	-- i.e. minus the part that is trimmed off).  (note: you can also 
	make images bigger with this program, by specifying a larger width 
	and height than were originally there.)

	Trim_slc creates a valid LAS 6.0 DDR (data descriptor record) from
	the metadata.  You do not need to create a DDR for the input data.

	This program should work with, but has not been tested with,
	RADARSAT era datafiles and metadata.

EXAMPLES:

	If you have an ASF CEOS image named "R102.D" and "R102.L", and
	you want to convert the whole thing into a LAS 6.0 float-complex image
	named "lasimg.cpx" and "lasimg.ddr", probably for use in interferometry
	(and with resolve, the first step in the interferometry process), type:

	trim_slc R102 lasimg 0 0
	
	If you have the same situation, but you want only the first 
	1000 lines and 400 samples, type

	trim_slc R102 lasimg 0 0 1000 400
	
	If you want those 1000 lines and 400 samples from
	line 3000, sample 52 of the CEOS image, type
	
	trim_slc R102 lasimg 3000 52 1000 400

	Another example, to convert bob.D and bob.L, a Single-Look-Complex
  	image file into bill.cpx and bill.ddr, a Float-Complex image file,
	type:  trim_slc bob bill 0 0
