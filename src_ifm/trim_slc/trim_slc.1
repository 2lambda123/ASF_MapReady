NAME: trim_slc

SYNOPSIS:
   
	trim_slc [-height <trim_ht>] [-width <trim_wid>] <inSLC> <outCPX>
	         <top line> <left samp>

DESCRIPTION:

	Trim_slc does two things: it converts a single-look-complex format
	image into an ASF tools format float-complex image, and allows you  to
	trim that image.  The DDR's master line and master sample  fields ARE
	maintained.

	You specify the input, output filenames, and a top left coordinate. 
	Trim_slc will create a new image in outfile which starts at these
	coordinates. Optionally, you can also specify the new height and width
	of the output image (if not specified, trim will use the old size minus
	the top left coordinates -- i.e. minus the part that is trimmed off).
	(note: you can also make images bigger with this program, by specifying
	a larger width and height than were originally there.)

	This program should work with, but has not been tested with, RADARSAT
	era datafiles and metadata.

EXAMPLES:

	If you have an ASF CEOS image named "R102.D" and "R102.L", and you want
	to convert the whole thing into a ASF tools format float-complex image
	named "asf_img.cpx" and "asf_img.meta", probably for use in
	interferometry (and with resolve, the first step in the interferometry
	process), type:

	> trim_slc R102 asf_img 0 0
	
	If you have the same situation, but you want only the first 
	1000 lines and 400 samples, type

	> trim_slc -height 1000 -width 400 R102 asf_img 0 0
	
	If you want those 1000 lines and 400 samples from
	line 3000, sample 52 of the CEOS image, type
	
	> trim_slc R102 asf_img 3000 52 1000 400

	Another example, to convert bob.D and bob.L, a Single-Look-Complex
  	image file into bill.cpx and bill.meta, a Float-Complex image file,
	type:
	
	> trim_slc bob bill 0 0
