NAME:  register_slc

SYNOPSIS:  register_slc <file 1> <file 2> <igram> 
          		[-g <grid_resolution>] [-s [-w]] [-a]
	  		[-W <start_line> <start_sample> <height> <width>]

  <file 1> a Single-Look-Complex file (.D and .L or other metadata)
  <file 2> a Single-Look-Complex file (.D and .L or other metadata)
  <igram> the output interferogram (.amp, .phase, .ddr)

DESCRIPTION:
    
    Register_slc will convert the two images to float complex format,
    and then run register_cpx to coregister the two images, using resolve,
    fico, fit_plane, and remap.
    
    After running this program you have an interferogram, which you can
    view with ml, generate a DEM with tandem_ifm(1), or use for your own
    science.
    
    An estimate of the baseline is written to base.00.



OPTIONS:

  [-g <grid_resolution>]  grid resolution for fico(1).
		(the default is 20, for a 20x20 grid)
  [-s] use Sinc kernel to do the remapping-- this is
		slower, but may result in higher quality.
		The default is bilinear interpolation.
  [-w] create and use a non-linear warping image instead
		of a linear planar map.  See fit_warp(1).
		Can only be used with sinc.
  [-a] Use cpx_autofilter to attempt to improve interferogram
		coherence (takes extra time)
  [-W <start_line> <start_sample> <height> <width>]
		Specify the window starting place and size.
	<start line>,<start sample> Define the vertical and horizontal
		coordinates of the top left corner of the desired section.
	<heigth>,<width> Define the height and width of the output images.
