.TH ml 1 "June 1997"
.SH NAME:
ml \- convert an interferogram's .amp & .phase files into an image.
.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B "ml"
[-l \fIh\fPx\fIw\fP] [-s \fIh\fPx\fIw\fP] [-n metafile] [-a]
.BI "<interferogram> <outfile>"
.SH DESCRIPTION:
.B "Ml"
(multilook) is a low pass filter which also makes the image square (i.e. 
makes the aspect ratio equal to one).  It does this by performing a box 
average on some number of pixels.
.PP
For ERS-1, and ERS-2, this box should be 5 pixels in azimuth
by 1 pixel in range in order to produce neraly square pixels (This is the default).
For JRS, the box should be 3x1 pixels.
For RADARSAT, the box should be 3x1 for most beams, but 1x1 for fine beams.
.PP
In
.B "ml",
look area is defined using option switches, but has default values of 1
col (1 pixel in range) and 5 rows (5 pixels in azimuth). The step area 
defines the size of the input area that will be made equal to 1 pixel 
in the output area. The look area defines how much input data will be 
used to determine the value of one pixel in the output data. 
.B "Ml"
uses default values of 1 col and 5 rows for step area. In most cases,
the default look values should work. For noisy data, try a look area of 2
cols by 10 rows. 
.PP
To calculate multilooked amplitude, add the square of each amplitude value
in look area.  Divide by the number of amplitude entries and take square
root of this value.  To calculate multilooked phase, add all the real
parameters of each entry in look area. Then add all the imaginary
parameters of each entry in look area. Take atan2() of imag over real. 
.PP
Multilook creates an amp, phase, and a corresponding LAS image file
including a DDR file. The image file has byte data in 3 bands. The first
band corresponds to red, the second to green, and the third to blue. The
bands are in sequential order. 
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "-l \fIh\fPx\fIw\fP"
Change the height (azimuth size) and width (range size) of the look box. Default is 5x1.
.TP 8
.B "-s \fIh\fPx\fIw\fP"
Change the height and width of the step box. Default is 5x1.
.TP 8
.B "-n metafile"
Change the look and step box to nLooks by 1 (as read from metafile).
.TP 8
.B "<interferogram>"
Input interferogram files (.amp, .phase, .ddr). Usually the output of igram(1).
.TP 8
.B "<outfile>"
Output image (.amp, .phase, .img, .ddr).
.B "Ml"
creates a LAS 6.0 image with a corresponding DDR that can be displayed. 
All extensions are automatically added.
.SH ERROR MESSAGES:

-------------------------------------------------------
.SH EXAMPLES:
.ce 1
example% ml ifm1 fred
.PP
Multilook the amplitude and phase files ifm1.amp and ifm1.phase using
image dimensions in ifm1.ddr, and store the results in fred.img, 
fred.ddr, fred.amp and fred.phase.
.PP
.ce 1
example% ml -l 10x2 ifm1 fred
.PP
Same as above except change the look area to 10 rows and 2 cols.
