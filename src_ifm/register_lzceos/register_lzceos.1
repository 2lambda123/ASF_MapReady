NAME: register_lzceos

SYNOPSIS: register_lzceos <file 1> <file 2> <igram> 
                     [ <grid resolution> [ <line 1> <line 2> ] ]
  <file 1> an ASF LZP ceos file (.D & .L or .raw & .ldr);
		you must include the .D or .raw extension
  <file 2> an ASF LZP ceos file (.D & .L or .raw & .ldr);
		you must include the .D or .raw extension
  <igram> the output interferogram (.amp, .phase, .ddr)
  [ <grid resolution> ] is the grid resolution for fico(1).
                           (the default is 20, for a 20x20 grid)
  <line 1>  first line to process for file #1
  <line 2>  first line to process for file #2

DESCRIPTION: 
	
  Register_lzceos will run the Alaska SAR processor
  on the two images, then coregister the two images
  using resolve, fico, fit_line, and calc_deltas,
  then re-process the second image so that it matches 
  up with (is coregistered with) the first.
  The result will be an inteferogram.
  After this, you can generate a DEM with tandem_ifm.

  The register_lzceos script automates the process of sub-pixel
  registration for ASF Level-Zero Ceos data.  This script will take
  the data, SAR process it, sub-pixel register it, and make it into
  an interferogram.
  
  After running this script, you can generate a DEM with
  tandem_ifm(1), or use the interferogram for your own science.
