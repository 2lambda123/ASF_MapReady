NAME: lz2raw_flywheel

SYNOPSIS: 

	lz2raw_flywheel [-log <file>][-quiet][-prc <path>] <input> <output>

		<input>   VEXCEL Leverl-0 signal data
		<output>  AISP-compatible raw data

DESCRIPTION:
	
	lz2raw_flywheel is different from the original lz2raw in that
	it checks for and corrects missing lines and well as truncated
	lines in ERS data.  Note, this is ONLY FOR ERS DATA.

	The lz2raw_flywheel converts the given VEXCEL Level-0 signal data 
	file into an AISP-compatible raw format.  It extracts the necessary
	processing parameters (slant range, prf, satellite mode) from the
	satellite headers, which it copiously outputs during processing.
	It checks for and corrects missing lines and truncated lines ONLY
	in ERS data.  It extracts state vectors from the VEXCEL .par file.

	The currently supported satellites are:
		-ERS-1 and ERS-2
		-JERS
		-RADARSAT, all beams & modes (excluding SCANSAR)

OPTIONS:

	[-log <file>]  Option to have output written to a log file.
	[-quiet]       Option to have the output surpressed to essential
	[-prc <path>]  Path to use percision state vectors (assume prc format)

EXAMPLES:

	> lz2raw_flywheel RSAT_02.000 format_02.raw
	Converts the superPrep data file RSAT_02.000 into the
	AISP raw input file format_02.raw.  This file can later
	be SAR processed using "aisp format_02.raw aisp_02" or
	"quicklook format_02.raw quick_02".

SEE ALSO:
	aisp, quicklook, ceos2raw

HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:

BUGS: 
	Does not compensate for skipped lines for JERS or RSAT.
	Output is very inefficient for SCANSAR images.  
	SCANSAR images cannot be quicklooked.
