.SH NAME:
fico \- performs sub-pixel correlation

.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B fico
.BI "[-g <grid_resolution>] [-f] [-log <file>] [-quiet]"
.in 10
.B "<file1> <file2> <control> <out>"
.in -10

.SH DESCRIPTION:
Fico is a program used to perform sub-pixel correlation during the process of
interferometry. It only works with complex images.
.PP
The way fico works is it correlates (that is, match up) two images at various
points in the image. The points it matches up are arranged in a grid. The number
of points in this grid can be set by the command line.
.PP
Fico needs an gross estimate (to a single pixel) of the offset between the two
images; it gets this offset from its control file. For each grid point, Fico
computes the phase coherence of several offsets near the gross offset, and
searches for the highest coherence offset.  It then refines this offset by
performing a parabolic interpolation on the nearby coherence values.
.PP
Fico now double-checks its result by running the same calculation with the
images reversed.  If the two results agree, the point is "good" and is output.
If the results disagree, the correlation is "bad" and is not output.
.PP
In addition to the offset, fico also calculates the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
at each point.  This can be used as a measure of the quality of the correlation.
Correlation points with a low SNR are bad.
.PP
If fico does not find many good points, you may not get an interferogram when
you interfere the two images. This can be the result of several things: your
interferometric baseline might be too big, and there will never be an
interferogram between the images; the initial offset in the fico control file is
incorrect, and fico cannot find anything that looks like interferometric phase.
.PP
Increasing the number of grid points slows the program down, but generates more
output for fit_line or fit_plane, which then improves the coherence.

.SH OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "file 1"
The first image file (which will not be moved.)
.TP 8
.B "file 2"
The second image file (which will be moved.)
.TP 8
.B "control"
File generated by resolve(1), formatted as such:
.br
   <offset x (integer)>
.br
   <offset y (integer)>
.br
   <correlation chip size (32)>
.br
   <fraction of a pixel (1)>
.br
   <maximum possible offset in X (4.1)>
.br
   <maximum possible offset in Y (6.1)>
.TP 8
.B "out"
A list of points, and the offset (relative to resolve's initial offset) at each
point. The format is:
.br
   <img1 X> <img1 Y> <img2 X> <img2 Y> <snr>
.TP 8
.B "-g \fRgrid_resolution\fP"
Fico will correlate that number of grid points per axis. The total number of
points in the grid is this parameter squared, so using large values will take a
long time to complete. (e.g. if a 20x20 grid (the default) takes 2 min, a 40x40
grid would take approx. 8 minutes.)
.TP 8
.B "-f"
Fico will use a complex FFT to attempt to match the two images. This seems to
work better in cases where the coherence is very low. If the standard coherence
matching algorithm fails, try using the complex FFT matching.
.TP 8
.B "-log \fRfile\fP"
Option to have the output written to a log file.
.TP 8
.B "-quiet"
Option to have the output surpressed to the essential.

.SH EXAMPLES:
If you had just run resolve to generate a control point file "ctrl1", and you
had two float complex (.cpx and .ddr) image files named "img1" and "img2", and
you wanted to perform correlation (at the default 10x10 grid resolution, running
100 points) to generate an offset point file "fico1", you would type:
.ce 1
example% fico img1 img2 ctrl1 fico1
