NAME:	fix_in_fromraw

SYNOPSIS:  fix_in_fromraw <infile.par> <infile.meta> <in/outfile.in> [# samples] [-log <file>] [-quiet]

  <infile.par>	  is a .par input file with the .par extension.
  <infile.meta>   is a .meta input file with the .meta extension.
  <in/outfile.in> is a .in file with the .in extension, it is modified to contain
		   corrected doppler polynomial coefficients.
	
DESCRIPTION:
	
	This program reads the .par and .meta files and calculates the 
	coefficients for the doppler polynomial based on the center time of 
	the swath.  The coefficients are read into the .in file which 
	is included on the command line.

OPTIONS:

   [# samples]	   is an optional parameter that indicates the number of samples 
		   across the range that will be used in the calculation of the 
		   doppler polynomial.  The default is 100.
   [-log <file>]   Option to have output written to a log file.
   [-quiet]	   suppresses the output to the essential
