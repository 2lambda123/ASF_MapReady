NAME: lz2raw


SYNOPSIS: lz2raw <input superPrep signal> <output> 


DESCRIPTION:
	
    lz2raw converts the given VEXCEL Level-0 signal data file into
an AISP-compatible raw format.  It extracts the necessary processing
parameters (slant range, prf, satellite mode) from the satellite
headers, which it copiously outputs during processing.  It extracts
state vectors from the VEXCEL .par file.

The currently supported satellites are:
	-ERS-1 and ERS-2
	-JERS
	-RADARSAT, all beams & modes (excluding SCANSAR)

ERROR MESSAGES:
    MESSAGE GIVEN:			REASON:
    --------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:
	> lz2raw RSAT_02.000 format_02.raw
	Converts the superPrep data file RSAT_02.000 into the
AISP raw input file format_02.raw.  This file can later
be SAR processed using "aisp format_02.raw aisp_02" or
"quicklook format_02.raw quick_02".

	> lz2raw RSAT_12.000 beam2.raw 2
	Extract beam number 2 (the third beam) from the
SCANSAR superPrep file RSAT_12.000.  Produces AISP raw input file 
beam2.raw, which only contains pulses from beam 2.

SEE ALSO:
	aisp, quicklook, ceos2raw

HARDWARE/SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:

BUGS:	
	Does not compensate for skipped lines.
Output is very inefficient for SCANSAR images.  
SCANSAR images cannot be quicklooked.
