NAME:
   avg_in_dop

SYNOPSIS:
  avg_in_dop [-log <file>] <infile1.in> <infile2.in> <outfile>

  <infile1.in> is the first .in file with the .in extension.
  <infile2.in> is the second .in file with the .in extension.
  <outfile>    is the output file which contains the averaged
                doppler coefficients of infile1 and infile2

DESCRIPTION:

  This program takes two *.in files as inputs and averages the
  doppler polynomials, which is then written into the outfile
  given on the command line. The doppler coefficients are
  stored in the order: fd fdd fddd.

OPTIONS:

  -log	Allows output to be written to a log <file>.
