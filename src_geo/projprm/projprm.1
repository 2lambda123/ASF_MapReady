NAME:		projprm  -- creates a projection parameter table file

SYNOPSIS:       projprm [-log <file>] projection prjkey outfile [options]

DESCRIPTION:	Creates a PROJ parameter labeled table file.

OPTIONS:
	Projections supported:  	PLSTEREO (Polar Stereographic)
					UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
						
	prjkey				User defined projection key
        
	outfile				user defined projection file. This
					file will either be created or
					updated depending on whether the file
					exists or not. 

	[-log <file>]			Allows the output to be written to
					a log file.

	[options]			Each projection has unique options
					which may be required. A quick look
					at a particular projection's extra
					options can be viewed from the
					command line by filling in the first
					four parameters.
	PROJECTION	OPTION
	---------	--------------------------------------------------
	PLSTEREO:

	  -l longitude	Center Longitude. This is the longitude that the map
			is centered upon. Must be in same units as determined
			by the -g option.
	  -p stdparl	Standard Parallel. The latitude where the scale will
			be true. This is also the latitude where the
			projection surface is tangent to or intersects the
			surface of the Earth. Must be same units as
			determined by the -g option.
	  -g geounits	(optional) Units which -l and -s are entered. Can be
			DEG (degrees), MIN (minutes), SEC (seconds), or DMS
			(Degrees Minutes Seconds  +DDDMMMSSS.SS) Defaults to
			DEG.
	  -d datum	(optional) Reference datum. Sets the semimajor axis
			and eccentricity squared for the particular
			projection. Set to 0 (Clarke 1866) by default.
			You may also want to use 12 (WGS 84).
	  -s smajoraxs	(optional) The semimajor axis of the Earth's
			ellipsoid in meters. Default is NULL (\0).
	  -q ecsqval	(optional) Eccentricity Squared Value. This value is
			treated in three different ways. 1. If value is zero,
			the earth is assumed to be a sphere. 2. If the value
			is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, the
			value is the eccentricity squared of the ellipsoid.
			3. If the value is greater than 1, it is assumed to
			be the semimajor axis of the ellipsoid. Defaults to
			0.
	  -e faleast	(optional) False easting. Offset of central meridian
			entered in meters. Defaults to 0.
	  -n falnorth   (optional) False northing. Offset of the origin of
	                the projection, entered in meters. Defaults to 0.

	UTM:

	  In the following three options, either the zonenum (-z) or the 
	  latitude and longitude (-a & -l) must be specifed. Latitude and
	  Longitude are in the same units as specified by geounits (-g).

	  -z zonenum    Zone Number. This is the number of the UTM zone in
			which the input coordinates are contained.
	  -a latitude   (optional) The latitude of any point within the UTM
			zone.
	  -l longitude	(optional) The longitude of any point within the UTM
			zone.
	  -g geounits   (optional) Unit of measure in which -l and -a 
			are specified.  Will be ignored with -z. Defaults
			to DEG.
	  -d datum	(optional) Reference datum. Sets the semimajor axis
			and eccentricity squared for the particular
			projection. Set to 0 (Clarke 1866) by default.
			You may also want to use 12 (WGS 84).

EXAMPLES:
  Projprm creates a projection definition file. This file contains the
  parameters used to transform coordinate pairs from one map projection to
  another. To create projection parameters for polar stereographic for SSMI
  the following parameters must be entered:
     projection = plstereo
     semi-major axis = 6378273.0 (Hughes Ellipsoid)
     eccentricity = 0.006693883 (Hughes Ellipsoid)
     central longitude = -45.0
     latitude of equal area = 70.0

  If you wanted to create a projection file called polar.proj with a 
  projection key ps1 using these parameters, type the following command at the
  unix prompt. (The \ should not be typed. It is there to clarify that the
  line has wrapped.)
     
    example% projprm plstereo ps1 polar.proj -s 6378273  \
	     -q .006693883 -l -45 -p 70

  As a further example, you can create a UTM projection in the same file with
  a key of utm1 for Alaska with the following command.

    example% projprm utm umt1 polar.proj -z 05
