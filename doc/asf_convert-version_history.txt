Convert Version History

v3.0.21 (released 2007 February 8)
Improved datum and spheroid support
Added new metadata values:
  In the "general" block:
    sensor_name (name of sensor used by the satellite)
    no_data (value a pixel is set to if there is no data available there)
  In the "sar" block:
    earth_radius_pp (earth radius calculated by the precision processor)
    polarization (polarization of the beam)
Moved metadata value "average_height" from the "general" block to the
  "projection" block
Adjustment made for erroneous earth radius given by the precision processor
Added azimuth scaling to correct for precision processor velocity errors
Fixed off-by-one error in x/y pixel sizes (perX, perY) in the ddr to meta data
  conversion
Fixed north direction in geotiffs created from scenes that have descending
  orbits
Added SGF (RADARSAT fine beam) as a valid product type for RSI and CDPF data
Added installation documentation
Several minor bug fixes (eg memory leaks)

GUI
Added datum selection drop-down and "Ignore projection errors" checkbox
On Windows, use the native file selector dialog instead of the GTK file selector
Added support to view a bounding box representing the geolocation of the output
  image in the Google Earth (tm) software
Eliminated "scale output" option on export tab. Pixel size option on Geocode
  tab is utilized instead.
Corrected inaccuracies in summary section when histogram equalization has been
  selected
Default to UTM projection, applying the most-appropriate zone, when geocoding is
  selected but no map projection is specified.
Better thumbnailing support and thumbnails for output images
New "DEM" tab allows for terrain correction or refinement of the SAR geolocation
  with the assistance of a user provided DEM
Made the "Stop" button more responsive
Add labels to the checkboxes on geocode and export

Command Line
asf_convert
  Added ability to specify a name for the temporary directory in the Convert
    configuration file (asf_convert).
asf_import
  Ingest USGS seamless server format GeoTIFF DEM files (for terrain correction
    only)
  Ingest ENVI ArcGIS format GeoTIFF files (for terrain correction masking only)
  Added -image-data-type option (can specify dem, mask, or geocoded)
  Fix bug that would cause a crash if latitude constraints were not set when
    importing STF format data
asf_terrcorr - New tool!
  Terrain corrects data
  Added Terrain Correction capabilities:
  Can mask out regions that yield poor co-registration using a user-provided
    mask file
  Ability to mask out water regions automatically
  Automatic layover and shadow masking
  SAR co-registration with DEM (foreword-geocoded with DEM converted to slant
      range in SAR-coordinates)
  Option to keep intermediate files
refine_geolocation - New tool!
  Refines the geolocation of SAR data using a DEM the user provides
mosaic - New tool!
  Rudimentary tool that can combine many ASF-format geocoded images into one
    image. Inputs must have the same projection parameters and pixel size.
akdem_grab - New tool!
  Retrieves a DEM from the USGS seamless server when given corner coordinates
asf_geocode
  Added background fill option
  Exit with an error if no projection is specified
  Added ability to project ingested lat/lon format DEM files (for terrain
    correction only)
asf_export
  Fix scaling calculation used in histogram equalization when downsampling
    output to byte
  Can now accept other input data types (no longer needs to be floating point)
  Allow input basename to have a "." in it.
metadata
  n/a


2.1.9 (released 2006 May 15)
RPM installer for linux
Use autoconf/configure for source distribution
Added meta->sar->azimuth_processing_bandwidth field to the metadata file
Added meta->sar->chirp_rate field to the metadata file
Added meta->sar->pulse_duration field to the metadata file
Added meta->sar->range_sampling_rate field to the metadata file
Added meta->general->average_height field to the metadata file
Fixed metadata error reading whitespace on Windows
Fix memory error when internally copying the metadata structure
Fix for infrequent crash regarding the library level "get_look" function

GUI
Change "output directory" & "naming scheme" buttons no longer obliterate
  changes made by the other.
Items in the batch list update automatically (no longer require a mouse over)
When you right click on a dataset you can bring up ceos metadata
  (in the metadata gui)
When you right click on a dataset you can bring up asf metadata
  (after processing)
Windows file selector is now used on Windows instead of the GTK file selector
By default the GUI will now clean up intermediate files (this can be disabled
  via a checkbox)
CEOS Metadata viewer integrated into GUI

Import tab
  Keep intermediate files checkbox added
Radiometry
  Added a checkbox to output in the decible scale instead of power
Geocode tab
  Output pixel size option
  New projection: lambert conformal conic
Export tab
  Histogram equalization sample mapping method option (for mapping float to
    byte)

Command Line
All Convert command line tools
  Logging enabled
  Information in the help updated
  New -license option to display copyright & license
  New -version option to display version number and copyright
asf_convert
  Now operates via use of a configuration file
  Geocoding now available in the processing flow
asf_import
  Remove 0 fill on left or right of image
  Will now allow projected CEOS data to be imported (though it cannot be
    reprojected at this time)
  New -dB option to output calibrated data in decibles instead of the power
    scale (only works with -sigma, -beta, & -gamma flags)
asf_geocode
  New option "force" added (allows projections in bizarre locations)
  Reading & writing of projection files completely revamped
  Fixed bug which caused program to fail if a projection file was used
    with the UTM projection
  Properly update datum in the metadata
  Output pixel size option
  If the polarstereo projection is used, the default hemisphere is dynamically
    chosen based on the metadata (instead of always north)
asf_export
  Histogram equalization sample mapping method option (for mapping float to
    byte)
metadata
  n/a

2.0.1 (released 2005 April 28)
The ASF software tools are designed to make it easier for users to process ASF 
data products and translate them into a variety of other formats. A graphical 
user interface exists which guides the user through the process of ingesting, 
geocoding, and exporting datasets.

The tools can currently ingest most Level 1 ASF products, and produce geocoded 
(or ungeocoded) GeoTIFF, TIFF, JPEG, or portable pixmap images. The GUI that 
runs on the windows environment has 4 different tabs which allows the user to 
import, export, geocode to apply one of four projections and to modify how the 
radiometry is displayed.
