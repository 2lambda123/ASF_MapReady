The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) has developed a SAR Training Processor (STP)
This program is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processor integrated with a
graphical user interface (GUI) and is built for use in the ASF SAR training
courses. The STP assists users who are either new to SAR or who want a more
in-depth knowledge of SAR processing to learn what happens when a raw SAR image
is processed from Level 0 raw data to a Level 1 image via the range-Doppler
technique. The STP has built-in hooks that allow images to be written at each
processing stage, giving the user an insider's view of intermediate steps in the
process. The GUI allows the user to choose important parameters as well as which
SAR processing steps to perform in order to see the affects of each. It explains
each step and displays the imagery produced. With this capability at their
fingertips, users are able to better understand the significance of each step in
the range-Doppler SAR processing technique.
