# This make file lists all the external libraries used by the latest
# tools in one flat list, making no attempt to sort out the build
# order automatically.

# Note also that this simplistic build scheme takes the traditional
# built-too-much approach: building the default target all will
# rebuild everything.  So if you want to be sure all the prerequisite
# to your tool are rebuilt, you should do a make all.  On the other
# hand, if you want to rebuild just the module you are working on,
# just do a make in that subdirectory.
