 0. You still have to do step (1) of the old procedure, I think.
    Could be that doing it correctly would avoid KLUDGE #2 ?!?!

 1. Update include/asf_version.h

    Figure out what the subversion revision number, mention it in the
    check-in.  Try to put the subversion number that will be attached
    to the Tag operation, which is the revision number of last check-in
    prior to bumping the version, +2.  (One for upping asf_version,
    another for the tag.)

 2. Tag the repository:
      svn copy https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/trunk
               https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/tags/convert_vX-X-X

 3. Create a clean directory, for example:
      mkdir ~/asf/svn-rXXXX
      cd ~/asf/svn-rXXXX

 4. Update this line in ~/.rpmmacros
      %_topdir        %(echo $HOME)/asf/svn-rXXXX/release

 5. Export the tagged repository:
      svn export
      https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/tags/convert_vX-X-X asf_tools

 6. ** KLUDGE #1 **
    Edit asf_tools/Makefile.in, eliminate the following from MODULES:
      src/asf_lt
      src/asf_geolib
      src/ardop

    ALOS release, 3.1: also eliminate:
      src/asf_terrcorr
      src/refine_geolocation
      src/sr2gr
      src/gr2sr
      src/mosaic

 7. Check out the important parts of the release directory:
      svn co https://lindon/svn/repos/release/trunk/autotar release/autotar
      svn co https://lindon/svn/repos/release/trunk/rpmbuild release/rpmbuild
      mkdir -p release/tar_filelist release/tar/convert

 8. Create the source.convert file:
      cd asf_tools/make_support; make; ./makemake; cd -

8A. ** KLUDGE #2 ** 
    Remove tcl/Tk gzips from the archive
      cd asf_tools/external/work_dir/tcl_tk; rm *.gz; cd -

 9. ** KLUDGE #3 **
      cd release/autotar
    Edit release/autotar/source.convert, adding these items:
src/libasf_sar
src/libasf_insar
external
src/asf_convert_gui
src/metadata_gui

10. Run the autotar script:
      ./tarfile src ~/asf/svn-rXXXX convert

11. Run the rpmprep script:
      ./rpmprep convert asf_convert
    ALOS:
      ./rpmprep convert alos_convert

12. Edit the .spec file in ../rpmbuild to use the correct version,
    then rename the file to match.
      cd ../rpmbuild
      vi asf_convert-2.1.0-1.spec
      mv asf_convert-2.1.0-1.spec asf_convert-X.X.X-1.spec

13. Build the rpm:
      rpmbuild -ba asf_convert-X.X.X-1.spec

14. Create tarballs of the rpms.  The binary rpm will also contain the
    README_rpm.txt file from ../../asf_tools.
      ./tarrpms asf_convert
    ALOS:
      ./tarrpms alos_convert

15. Put the built files on quantum or someplace:
      scp RPMS/asf_convert-X.X.X-1.i386.rpm
          'quantum://shares/utd/Releases\ for\ Data\ Quality/Linux'
      scp SRPMS/asf_convert-X.X.X-1.i386.rpm
          'quantum://shares/utd/Releases\ for\ Data\ Quality/Linux'
      cd ../tar/asf_convert
      scp asf_convert.src.tar.gz
          'quantum://shares/utd/Releases\ for\ Data\ Quality/Source/asf_convert-X.X.X.src.tar.gz'

16. Bump the version in include/asf_version.h, add "-dev" to the end.

17. The windows procedure is the same as described below.  Notes:

  A. When checking out the windows version, you might have to manually
     edit make_support/system_rules (after running configure) to make
     sure it has:
           JPEG_LIBS = $(LIBDIR)/libjpeg.a
     and NOT
           JPEG_LIBS = -ljpeg

Old instructions follow:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a tool package

Note that for any of this to work on windows, you must have cygwin
installed.

 1. If you want to meddle with what the package will include you'll need to
    edit asf_tools/make_support/master_program_list. That is where all the
    tools to be compiled are listed with other tools that they depend on.
    There's also a CATEGORIES category. You can make special groupings of tools
    in CATEGORIES section (eg convert which includes asf_convert,
    asf_convert_gui, asf_export, and asf_import).

 2. Update include/asf_version.h to reflect correct package version numbers.

 3. Commit all necessary changes to the CVS repository.  Especially
    important is committing the version number change!

 4. Apply cvs tags if so desired. Say you're packaging your brand spanking new
    version 2.5 of the convert package. Make sure you've removed that pesky
    asf_tools/unsupported directory, then do:
    /dir/that/asf_tools/resides/in> cvs rtag convert_v2-5 asf_tools

 5. Now, on every platform that you want to create a package for, grab the
    tools from CVS. You'll need to do this in a directory where the the
    'release' directory resides. If you tagged stuff do:
    /base/dir> cvs export -r convert_v2-5 asf_tools
    if you didn't tag stuff (which you should have done!):
    /base/dir> cvs export -D now asf_tools

 6. Remember, you want to have the tools in the same directory that the release
    tree is in (so you've got /base/dir/asf_tools and /base/dir/release). With
    that in mind cd into asf_tools and run the config script.
    /base/dir> cd asf_tools
    /base/dir/asf_tools> ./config

 7. Since we're making a release here, you want and optimized version, not a
    debugging version.
    /base/dir/asf_tools> unset DEBUG_BUILD

 8. Okay we're ready to build:
    /base/dir/asf_tools> make

 9.  Now that the tools are built, cd to the release/autotar directory
    /base/dir/asf_tools> cd ../release/autotar

10. For Unix: 

    This directory has been populated with several binary.* and source.* files.
    They were written by the config script which uses the program makemake (in
    asf_tools/make_support). There are also a couple of scripts; tarfile and
    tarallsource. Tarallsource does exactly as its name implies. The tarfile
    script uses the binary.* and source.* files to figure out what each package
    needs to be complete. It creates the <package>.<platform>.<bin|src>.tar.gz
    file for web distribution. For example, to make the binary distribution of
    the convert package on linux you'd create the file convert.linux.bin.tar.gz
    in /base/dir/release/tar/convert by doing:
    /base/dir/release/autotar> ./tarfile bin /base/dir convert

    For windows:

    You must have the Nullsoft installer system installed on the
    build machine for this build step.

    Edit 

      /base/dir/release/windows_installer/convert_package/ConvertPackageInstall

    and update the locations of the tool binaries and the cygwin
    binaries directories.

    In a widows file manager thingy window, right click on the script
    we just edited and select 'compile NSIS script'.

    Create a tarball of the generated binary
   
    Currently we are using the naming scheme: 
       tar czvf convert.<version_number>.bin.win32.tar.gz 
           ASF_Convert_Setup.exe

    However in the future we hope to start using this one:
       tar czvf convert.<version_number>.bin.win32.tar.gz 
           ASF_Convert_Setup.exe

11. The current procedure for delivery onto the web (this procedure
    could easily change while leaving the rest of this document mostly
    correct) is to upload to the machine 'seth'.  Login with username
    'asfsw' and password '[web_g00nz]'.  Then do:
  
       cd Incoming/
       mkdir v<version_number>

    Now log back out and do:

       scp <tarball> asfsw@seth.asf.alaska.edu:/Incoming/v<version_number>/

    Now be sure to tell the web monkey (currently Charley Slater) that
    its there and waiting for him!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STP Instructions!

 0. You still have to do step (1) of the old procedure, I think.
    Could be that doing it correctly would avoid KLUDGE #2 ?!?!

 1. Update STP_VERSION in src/stp/ardop_gui.c

 2. Tag the repository:
      svn copy https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/trunk
               https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/tags/stp_vX-X-X

 3. Create a clean directory, for example:
      mkdir ~/asf/svn-rXXXX
      cd ~/asf/svn-rXXXX

 4. Update this line in ~/.rpmmacros
      %_topdir        %(echo $HOME)/asf/svn-rXXXX/release

 5. Export the tagged repository:
      svn export
      https://lindon/svn/repos/asf_tools/tags/stp_vX-X-X asf_tools

 6. ** KLUDGE #1 **
    Edit asf_tools/Makefile.in, the MODULES section should be changed to:

MODULES = \
	src/asf \
	src/libasf_proj \
	src/asf_meta \
	src/asf_odl \
	src/asf_fft \
        src/libifm \
	src/libasf_ardop \
	src/ardop \
	src/stp \
        src/multilook \
        src/c2p \
        src/convert2jpeg \
        src/stats

    Get rid of the 'projections' stuff in the install target.

 7. Check out the important parts of the release directory:
      svn co https://lindon/svn/repos/release/trunk/autotar release/autotar
      svn co https://lindon/svn/repos/release/trunk/rpmbuild release/rpmbuild
      mkdir -p release/tar_filelist release/tar/stp

7A. You may need to manually add
      stp { BINS ardop }
    to the master_program_list at the end of the PROGRAMS section.

 8. Create the source.stp file:
      cd asf_tools/make_support; make; ./makemake; cd -

8A. ** KLUDGE #2 ** 
    Remove tcl/Tk gzips from the archive
      cd asf_tools/external/work_dir/tcl_tk; rm *.gz; cd -

 9. ** KLUDGE #3 **
      cd release/autotar
    Edit release/autotar/source.stp, adding these items:
external
src/ardop
src/libasf_ardop
src/libifm
src/multilook
src/c2p
src/convert2jpeg
src/convert_meta
src/stats

10. Run the autotar script:
      ./tarfile src ~/asf/svn-rXXXX stp

11. **SKIP**

12. Edit the .spec file in ../rpmbuild to use the correct version,
    then rename the file to match.
      cd ../rpmbuild
      vi stp-1.0.0-1.spec
      mv stp-1.0.0-1.spec stp-X.X.X-1.spec

13. Build the rpm:
      rpmbuild -ba stp-X.X.X-1.spec


17. The windows procedure is the same as described below.  Notes:

  A. When checking out the windows version, you might have to manually
     edit make_support/system_rules (after running configure) to make
     sure it has:
           JPEG_LIBS = $(LIBDIR)/libjpeg.a
     and NOT
           JPEG_LIBS = -ljpeg
