Creating a tool package

Note that for any of this to work on windows, you must have cygwin
installed.

 1. If you want to meddle with what the package will include you'll need to
    edit asf_tools/make_support/master_program_list. That is where all the
    tools to be compiled are listed with other tools that they depend on.
    There's also a CATEGORIES category. You can make special groupings of tools
    in CATEGORIES section (eg convert which includes asf_convert,
    asf_convert_gui, asf_export, and asf_import).

 2. Update include/asf_version.h to reflect correct package version numbers.

 3. Commit all necessary changes to the CVS repository.  Especially
    important is committing the version number change!

 4. Apply cvs tags if so desired. Say you're packaging your brand spanking new
    version 2.5 of the convert package. Make sure you've removed that pesky
    asf_tools/unsupported directory, then do:
    /dir/that/asf_tools/resides/in> cvs rtag convert_v2-5 asf_tools

 5. Now, on every platform that you want to create a package for, grab the
    tools from CVS. You'll need to do this in a directory where the the
    'release' directory resides. If you tagged stuff do:
    /base/dir> cvs export -r convert_v2-5 asf_tools
    if you didn't tag stuff (which you should have done!):
    /base/dir> cvs export -D now asf_tools

 6. Remember, you want to have the tools in the same directory that the release
    tree is in (so you've got /base/dir/asf_tools and /base/dir/release). With
    that in mind cd into asf_tools and run the config script.
    /base/dir> cd asf_tools
    /base/dir/asf_tools> ./config

 7. Since we're making a release here, you want and optimized version, not a
    debugging version.
    /base/dir/asf_tools> unset DEBUG_BUILD

 8. Okay we're ready to build:
    /base/dir/asf_tools> make

 9.  Now that the tools are built, cd to the release/autotar directory
    /base/dir/asf_tools> cd ../release/autotar

10. For Unix: 

    This directory has been populated with several binary.* and source.* files.
    They were written by the config script which uses the program makemake (in
    asf_tools/make_support). There are also a couple of scripts; tarfile and
    tarallsource. Tarallsource does exactly as its name implies. The tarfile
    script uses the binary.* and source.* files to figure out what each package
    needs to be complete. It creates the <package>.<platform>.<bin|src>.tar.gz
    file for web distribution. For example, to make the binary distribution of
    the convert package on linux you'd create the file convert.linux.bin.tar.gz
    in /base/dir/release/tar/convert by doing:
    /base/dir/release/autotar> ./tarfile bin /base/dir convert

    For windows:

    You must have the Nullsoft installer system installed on the
    build machine for this build step.

    Edit 

      /base/dir/release/windows_installer/convert_package/ConvertPackageInstall

    and update the locations of the tool binaries and the cygwin
    binaries directories.

    In a widows file manager thingy window, right click on the script
    we just edited and select 'compile NSIS script'.

    Create a tarball of the generated binary
   
    Currently we are using the naming scheme: 
       tar czvf convert.<version_number>.bin.win32.tar.gz 
           ASF_Convert_Setup.exe

    However in the future we hope to start using this one:
       tar czvf convert.<version_number>.bin.win32.tar.gz 
           ASF_Convert_Setup.exe

11. The current procedure for delivery onto the web (this procedure
    could easily change while leaving the rest of this document mostly
    correct) is to upload to the machine 'seth'.  Login with username
    'asfsw' and password '[web_g00nz]'.  Then do:
  
       cd Incoming/
       mkdir v<version_number>

    Now log back out and do:

       scp <tarball> asfsw@seth.asf.alaska.edu:/Incoming/v<version_number>/

    Now be sure to tell the web monkey (currently Charley Slater) that
    its there and waiting for him!
