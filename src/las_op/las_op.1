NAME: las_op

SYNOPSIS:
	las_op [-log <file>] <out.ext> "exp" <inA.ext> [<inB.ext> [...]]
	

DESCRIPTION:
	Las_op calculates an output image based on some mathematical
function of the input image (or images).  That is, if the expression is
"2*a", the output image's pixel values will be twice the input image's
pixel values.
	Works with any type of input data-- byte, short, long, or float.


OPTIONS:
  -log <file>	Option to have output written to a log file.

  <inB.ext>	Second input image.
  
  [...]		Additional input images

INPUT:
  <inA.ext>	first input image.

  "exp"		The expression parameter is a combination of constants 
		(numbers, like 5 or 1.23948) variables (a,b,c,... which represent 
		the input images) and the operators:

		 +   Addition, 3=2+1
		 -   Subtraction, 15=16-1
		 *   Multiplication, 6=2*3
		 /   Division, 4.5=9/2
		      Division by zero has no effect on a number, 5=5/0.
		 %   Modulus, the positive remainder after division, 0.56=3.56%1
		 ^   Exponentiation, 9=3^2

	
		These parts are combined in the expression in ordinary algebraic
		infix notation, with optional parenthesis.  The operator 
		precedence is:
		exponentiation left to right, then * / and % left to right, and
		finally + and -.

Note:	Negative numbers must be written in the form zero minus a positive
	quantity-- supporting negative numbers directly would have substantially 	complicated
	parsing.

OUTPUT:
  <out.ext>	is the name of a LAS 6.0 image to be created.


EXAMPLES:
  las_op out.img "100+a" in.img
	Creates out.img, whose pixels are 100 brighter than in.img

  las_op out.img "a+b" in1.img in2.img
	Creates out.img, whose pixels are the sum of in1.img and in2.img's pixels.

  las_op out.img "a^0.5" in.img
	Creates out.img, whose pixels are the square root of in.img's pixels.
