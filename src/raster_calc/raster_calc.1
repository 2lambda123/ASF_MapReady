NAME: raster_calc

SYNOPSIS:
        raster_calc [-log <file>] <out.ext> "exp" <inA.ext> [<inB.ext> [...]]

DESCRIPTION:
        Calculates an output image based on some mathematical function of the
        input image (or images).  That is, if the expression is "2*a", the
        output image's pixel values will be twice the input image's pixel
        values. Works with any type of input data-- byte, short, long, or float.

OPTIONS:
        -log <file>
            Write output to a log file (and the stdout).
        inB.ext
            Optional second input image.
        [...]
            Additional input images

ARGUMENTS:
        inA.ext
            The first (and perhaps only) input image.

        "exp"
            The expression parameter is a combination of constants (numbers,
            like 5 or 1.23948) variables (a,b,c,... which represent the input
            images) and the operators:

                 +   Addition, 3=2+1
                 -   Subtraction, 15=16-1
                 *   Multiplication, 6=2*3
                 /   Division, 4.5=9/2
                      Division by zero has no effect on a number, 5=5/0.
                 %   Modulus, the positive remainder after division, 0.56=3.56%1
                 ^   Exponentiation, 9=3^2

            These parts are combined in the expression in ordinary algebraic
            infix notation, with optional parenthesis.  The operator
            precedence is:
                1. exponentiation (left to right)
                2. * / and %      (left to right)
                3. + and -        (left to right)

            Note: Negative numbers must be written in the form zero minus a
                  positive quantity-- supporting negative numbers directly would
                  have substantially complicated parsing.

        out.ext
            The name of the image to be created.

EXAMPLES:
        > raster_calc out.img "100+a" in.img
            Creates out.img, whose pixels are 100 brighter than in.img

        > raster_calc out.img "a+b" in1.img in2.img
            Creates out.img, whose pixels are the sum of in1.img and in2.img's 
            pixels

        > raster_calc out.img "a^0.5" in.img
            Creates out.img, whose pixels are the square root of in.img's pixels
