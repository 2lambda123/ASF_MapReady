How to use ASAP:


	1)  Create an input vector file for gen_oe using either method a OR b.

	    a) Create a file containing:
		x		in km
		y		in km
		z		in km
		x'		in m/s
		y'		in m/s
		z'		in m/s
		start year
		start month
		start day
		start gmtSec
		end year
		end month
		end day
		emd gmtSec
		nsteps

            b) OR run the program make_input on an LZP ERS CEOS file.

	2)  Run "propagate <inVect> <outVect>" on your input vector file.

	    This will:
	
	      a)  Run "gen_oe" on your input vector file 
 	        gen_oe generates obital elements corresponding to the reference
                state vector.  It then creates the file "5" containing all of
                the parameters needed to run ASAP to get the state vector at
                the end time.
	
	      b)  Run "ASAP"
		ASAP will read the "5" file and create "fort.7" which
		contains the requested state vector propagation.

	      c)  Move the file "fort.7" to your desired output name
