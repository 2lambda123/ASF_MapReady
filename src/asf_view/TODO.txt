1. The size of the cache is still arbitrary at 1GB.  Need to be able to
   use a larger cache if possible, and a smaller one if necessary.

2. The "Settings" tab is empty.  Some ideas for what goes in here:

   a.  Choose what color the crosshairs/lines are.
   b.  Select how the data is mapped from floating points to bytes.  We
       currently only do 2-sigma.

3. Currently the only way to look at a band other than the first of a
   multi-band file is to use the "-band" command line option.  I don't
   know if this would be appropriate for the settings tab -- those
   probably shouldn't be image-specific, but somehow the user should be
   able to switch bands inside the program.  Another button in the
   toolbar, perhaps?  Brings up a band selector, then acts like you are
   loading a new file?

4. The histogram doesn't look good for raw ceos data, since it only has
   a subset of the full 0-256 range.  So, the histogram looks sparse.
   I'm not sure how to best solve this problem.  Make the bars wider,
   when this situation is detected?  Make the histogram shorter? Of course,
   the vertical spacing needs to be uniform, so we can't just shrink out
   the zero sections.

5. Support for geotiffs.

6. Support for other images types like png, pgm, etc.

7. Support for greyscale jpegs.

8. Support for combining multi-band images into color imagery.
