NAME:		projprm  -- creates a projection parameter table file

SYNOPSIS:       projprm [-log <file>] projection prjkey outfile [options]

DESCRIPTION:	Creates a PROJ parameter labeled table file.

OPTIONS:
	Projections supported:  	GEOGRAPH
					PLSTEREO (Polar Stereographic)
					UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
					LAMAZEQA (Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area)
					ALBERS (Albers Equal Area)	
						
	prjkey				User defined projection key
        
	outfile				user defined projection file. This
					file will either be created or
					updated depending on whether the file
					exists or not. 

	[-log <file>]			Allows the output to be written to
					a log file.

	[options]			Each projection has unique options
					which may be required. A quick look
					at a particular projection's extra
					options can be viewed from the
					command line by filling in the first
					four parameters.
	PROJECTION	OPTION
	---------	--------------------------------------------------
	GEOGRAPH:	

	  -d datum	(optional) Reference datum. Sets the semimajor axis
			and eccentricity squared for the particular
			projection. Set to 0 (Clarke 1866) by default.
			You may also want to use 12 (WGS 84).
	PLSTEREO:

	  -l longitude	Center Longitude. This is the longitude that the map
			is centered upon. Must be in same units as determined
			by the -g option.
	  -p stdparl	Standard Parallel. The latitude where the scale will
			be true. This is also the latitude where the
			projection surface is tangent to or intersects the
			surface of the Earth. Must be same units as
			determined by the -g option.
	  -g geounits	(optional) Units which -l and -s are entered. Can be
			DEG (degrees), MIN (minutes), SEC (seconds), or DMS
			(Degrees Minutes Seconds  +DDDMMMSSS.SS) Defaults to
			DEG.
	  -d datum	(optional) Reference datum. Sets the semimajor axis
			and eccentricity squared for the particular
			projection. Set to 0 (Clarke 1866) by default.
			You may also want to use 12 (WGS 84).
	  -s smajoraxs	(optional) The semimajor axis of the Earth's
			ellipsoid in meters. Default is NULL (\0).
	  -q ecsqval	(optional) Eccentricity Squared Value. This value is
			treated in three different ways. 1. If value is zero,
			the earth is assumed to be a sphere. 2. If the value
			is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, the
			value is the eccentricity squared of the ellipsoid.
			3. If the value is greater than 1, it is assumed to
			be the semimajor axis of the ellipsoid. Defaults to
			0.
	  -e faleast	(optional) False easting. Offset of central meridian
			entered in meters. Defaults to 0.
	  -n falnorth   (optional) False northing. Offset of the origin of
	                the projection, entered in meters. Defaults to 0.

	UTM:

	  In the following three options, either the zonenum (-z) or the 
	  latitude and longitude (-a & -l) must be specifed. Latitude and
	  Longitude are in the same units as specified by geounits (-g).

	  -z zonenum    Zone Number. This is the number of the UTM zone in
			which the input coordinates are contained.
	  -a latitude   (optional) The latitude of any point within the UTM
			zone.
	  -l longitude	(optional) The longitude of any point within the UTM
			zone.
	  -g geounits   (optional) Unit of measure in which -l and -a 
			are specified.  Will be ignored with -z. Defaults
			to DEG.
	  -d datum	(optional) Reference datum. Sets the semimajor axis

	  -g geounits   (optional) Units which -x and -y are specified in. Can
	  		be DEG (degrees), MIN (minutes), SEC (seconds), or
	  		DMS (Degree Minutes Seconds   +DDDMMMSSS.SS) Defaults
	  		to DEG.	  

	  -x latitude   Center Latitude coordinate.  This is the latitude that
	  		the projection is centered upon.  Specify in same units
	  		as -g option.
	  		
	  -y longitude  Center Longitude coordinate.  This is the longitude that
	  		the projection is centered upon.  Specify in same units
	  		as -g option.
	  		
	  -r radius	(optional) Radius of reference sphere.  If 0 is
			specified, 6370997 meters is used. Defaults to 6370997.
	  		
	  -e faleast	(optional) False easting. Offset of central meridian
			entered in meters. Defaults to 0.
			
	  -n falnorth	(optional) False northing. Offset of the origin of
	                the projection, entered in meters. Defaults to 0.

	ALBERS:
	
	  -g geounits   (optional) Units which -x and -y are specified in. Can
	  		be DEG (degrees), MIN (minutes), SEC (seconds), or
	  		DMS (Degree Minutes Seconds   +DDDMMMSSS.SS) Defaults
	  		to DEG.
	  
	  -a stdpar1	First Standard Parallel Parameter.  Latitude of the
			first standard parallel.  Specify in same units as -g
			option.

	  -c centmer	Central Meridian.  Longitude of the central meridian of
			the projection.  Specify in same units as -g option.
	  		
	  -o origin	(optional) Latitude of projection origin.  Defaults to
	                0.
	  
	  -s smaxis	(optional) Semi-Major Axis of the ellipsoid.  If none 
			is specified Clarke 1866 in meters is used.
			Mutually exclusive options:  (-s and -e) && (-d).
		     	Must use either -s and -e OR -d.  Cannot use both.
	  		
	  -e ecsqval	(optional) Eccentricity squared of the ellipsoid if
			less than zero.  If none is specified, the ellipsoid 
			is assumed to be a sphere.  If greater than zero,
			the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid is used.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:
  Projprm creates a projection definition file. This file contains the
  parameters used to transform coordinate pairs from one map projection to
  another. To create projection parameters for polar stereographic for SSMI
  the following parameters must be entered:
     projection = plstereo
     semi-major axis = 6378273.0 (Hughes Ellipsoid)
     eccentricity = 0.006693883 (Hughes Ellipsoid)
     central longitude = -45.0
     latitude of equal area = 70.0

  If you wanted to create a projection file called polar.proj with a 
  projection key ps1 using these parameters, type the following command at the
  unix prompt. (The \ should not be typed. It is there to clarify that the
  line has wrapped.)
     
    example% projprm plstereo ps1 polar.proj -s 6378273  \
	     -q .006693883 -l -45 -p 70

  As a further example, you can create a UTM projection in the same file with
  a key of utm1 for Alaska with the following command.

    example% projprm utm umt1 polar.proj -z 05
	
  As an example of the usage for the Lambert Equal Area Azimuthal Projection, 
  the projprm command is entered as follows.
  
    example% projprm lamazeqa lam1 lam.proj -x 90 -y -150 -r 0 -e 0 -n 0

  This creates a lam.proj file centered around the coordinate 90N Lat. and 
  150W Long. The -r 0 defaults to radius 6370997 meters. The false easting
  and northing are 0.

    example% projprm albers alb84 b.proj -a 55 -b 65 -c -154 -o 50 \
             -s 6378137.0 -e .00669438

  This creates the projection file b.proj.  The projection is centered around
  -154 Long and the 2 standard parallels are 55 and 65 N Lat.  The origin of
  the projection is 50 N Latitude.  The WGS84 datum is used.  The major or
  equatorial axis is 6378137.0 meters.  The eccentricity squared is
  0.00669438. (The \ should not be typed. It is there to clarify that the
  line has wrapped.)
