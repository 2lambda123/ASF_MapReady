NAME: ceos2raw

SYNOPSIS: ceos2raw <input CEOS signal> <output>


DESCRIPTION:
	ceos2raw converts the given CEOS signal data file into
	an AISP-compatible raw format.  It extracts the necessary processing
	parameters (slant range, prf, satellite mode) from the satellite
	headers, which it copiously outputs during processing.  It extracts
	state vectors from the CEOS platform position data record.

	The currently supported CEOS formats are:
		-ESA CCSD CEOS data
		-VEXCEL RSA-compatible CEOS signal data

	ASF CCSD data can be read directly by AISP and quicklook.


	The currently supported satellites are:
		-ERS-1 and ERS-2
		-JERS
		-RADARSAT, all beams & modes


EXAMPLES:
	> ceos2raw RSAT_02.D format_02.raw
	Converts the CEOS signal data file RSAT_02 into the
	
	AISP raw input file format_02.raw.  This file can later
	be SAR processed using "aisp format_02.raw aisp_02" or
	"quicklook format_02.raw quick_02".

	NOTE:  the input CEOS signal *must* have the .D
	or .raw extension for ceos2raw to work.

	aisp, quicklook, lz2raw

BUGS:
