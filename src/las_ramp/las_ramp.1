NAME: Las_ramp

SYNOPSIS:
    las_ramp <in img> <out img> <topleft line,sample> <ht> <wth> <min> <max>
    
DESCRIPTION:
	Overlays a ramp-- a smooth graduation of grey tones-- across
	any given LAS image.  This is useful in preparing scientific
	illustrations.
	The procedure works with any single-banded image (e.g., byte, 
	short, float...).
    
OPTIONS:
	These grey tones are contained in a rectangular box, whose top 
	left corner is at <topleft line,sample> and whose dimensions are 
	width <wth> by height <ht>.

	The grey tones are interpolated linearly across the box--
	if the box is tall and skinny, they blend from <min> at the top to 
	<max> at the bottom; if the box is wider than it is tall, they blend
	from <min> at the left edge to <max> at the right edge.

EXAMPLES:
las_ramp in.img out.img 20 30 100 400 0 255

	This call overlays a 400 pixel wide by 100 pixel tall box,
	ramping from 0 at the left to 255 at the right, and starting
	at line 20, sample 30, atop the LAS image <in img>.  The result is
	written to <out img>.
