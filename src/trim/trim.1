NAME: trim

SYNOPSIS:

	trim [-log <file>] [-h <trim height>] [-w <trim width>] 
	     <in> <out> <new top line> <new left sample> 

DESCRIPTION:

Trim will let you change the size of any LAS 6.0 single-band image.
It works on byte, short, long, float, (IEEE 4 byte), and complex data.  The 
data type of the output image is the same as that of the input image.

This program will create an output file <out>, which
is <in> file minus the trimmed number of lines and/or samples,
constrained to the new width and height.
(note: you can also make images bigger with this program,
by specifying a larger width and height than were originally
there.)

You specify the input and output filenames (WITH extension), and 
a top left coordinate.  Trim will create a new image in <out> file which
starts at these coordinates.  Optionally, you can also specify the new height 
and width of the output image (if not specified, trim will use the old size
minus the top left coordinates-- i.e. minus the part that is trimmed off).

Trim relies on DDR information to do the trimming, and maintains DDR
information through to the output.

Trim defines the top,left line and sample to be at (0,0).

OPTIONS:

	[-log <file>]      Option to have the output written to a file.
	[-h <trim_height>] Height of file to be output
	[-w <trim_width>]  Width of file to be output

EXAMPLES:

1.)	Trim's primary purpose is to allow you to work with a smaller image.
For example, if you're doing baseline refinement in interferometry, and
want the process to go more quickly, you can cut down the amound of data
the baseline refinement tools have to work on by trimming the data.
	If you want a 400x500 pixel scene from near the middle 
(coordinate 6000x800) of a 12800x2048 image called "img1.amp", type

	trim -h 400 -w 500 img1.amp smaller1.amp 6000 800

	Trim will generate smaller1.amp and smaller1.ddr
	

2.)	Trim can be used anytime you want to work with a smaller image, but
it also can be used to remove the CEOS header from an image (albeit the process
for doing so is a bit convoluted): since the RADARSAT-era CEOS header is one line
on top of the image, plus 192 bytes per line, we can just trim it off.  E.g.
if we have a byte CEOS image "bob.D" we wish to turn into a LAS image "bill.img", type

	trim bob.D bill.img 1 192

	Trim will generate bill.img and bill.ddr.  Note that for this to work, you
need a file called "bob.ddr" to describe bob.D's dimentions and data type-- but 
CEOS files don't ship with such a file.  This is the purpose of the makeddr program,
which should also be available from ASF.

3.)	Another example is to take a 100x150 (Line x Sample) window out of 
the top right corner (coordinate 50,1800) of a floating point image named 'bob.amp'
with dimensions of 4000x2000, type:

	trim -h 100 -w 150 bob.amp corner.amp 50 1800
