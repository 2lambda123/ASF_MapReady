    NAME:		coh - Calculates interferogram coherence 

    SYNOPSIS:    coh [-l linexsamp] [-s linexsample] [-x <file>]
                      In1 In2 Igram Out

      -l      change look box line and sample. Default = 10x2
      -s      change step box line and sample. Default = 5x1
      -x      allows the output to be written to a log file
      In1   is the image 1 complex file
      In2   is the image 2 complex file
      Igram  is the interferogram of the above two images
      Out    is a floating-point coherence file (.coh).


    DESCRIPTION:

	    This program is used after interferometry has been 
	performed in order to generate a coherence image-- a
	black and white image whose brightness corresponds to
	the quantity of variation (rho) observed in the
	interferogram. This rho can then be used to distinguish 
	between different features on the ground (especially 
	useful when those features have the same radar brightness),
	as well as give a quantitative evaluation of how
	sucessful the interferometry was.
	
	    This program operates on the raw interferogram,
	before multilooking (i.e. before the ml(1) program),
	because it performs multilooking as it computes rho.
	It defaults to reading the ddr to get the number of
	lines and samples in an image.  All filenames are
	without extentions.
	
	Coh calculates the coherence for the Igram using the following
	formula:
	 
			     | Sum (n pixels) { a x b* } |
	  | rho | =    __________________________________________
	
		       Sqrt [ Sum { |a x a*| }  Sum { |b x b*| } ]
	
	In this program n = 20 pixels: 10 in azimuth x 2 in range.

    EXAMPLES:
    	If you've just run 
    		igram img1 img2 interferogram
    	and you want to generate a coherence image bob.coh, type
    	
    		coh img1 img2 interferogram bob
