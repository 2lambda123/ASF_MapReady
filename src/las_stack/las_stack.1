NAME: las_stack

SYNOPSIS: las_stack <master> [ <img1> [...]]

DESCRIPTION: 
	Las_stack lines up each of the images you specify with
the given master image, then concatenates them into a colorized
combination image.

	It does the lining up using correlate(1), then
creates a lined-up "corr_<imgN>.img" for each input image.

	The input images must be all be single-band LAS 6.0 byte
images.

----------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:
	I have SAR images one.img, two.img, and three.img.
They are all of the same area, but each is offset by a few pixels.
I can line them up by running

	> las_stack one two three
	
	Which will generate stack.img, a colorized concatenation
of all three lined-up images; and corr_two.img and corr_three.img,
lined-up versions of each input image.
