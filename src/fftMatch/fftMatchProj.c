NAME: fftMatchProj

SYNOPSIS: fftMatchProj [-log <file>] [-quiet] <img1.ext> <img2.ext>

DESCRIPTION:

	fftMatch lines up two images, to slightly better the
	single-pixel precision.  It will work with images of any
	size, but is most efficient when the image dimensions are
	near a power of 2.  The images need not be square.

	The lining-up is performed using image correlation via
	the much-vaunted Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  The working
	space size is rounded up to the nearest power of 2 (for the FFT).
	The first image is read in completely, and a chip of the second
	image is also read in.  The average brightness of the chip is
	calculated and subtracted from both images.  The images are then
	FFT'd to frequency space, the FFT'd chip is conjugated, and the
	two images are multiplied together.  The product is inverse-FFT'd,
	and the resulting correlation image shows a brightness peak
	where the two images line up best.

BUGS:
	The images must have at least 75% overlap.
        fftMatch will occasionally fail to find the
        correct offset (especially with noisy images).
