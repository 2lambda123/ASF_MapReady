    NAME:	pcpx_autofilter - Parallelized automatic complex image bandpass
		filter

    SYNOPSIS:	pcpx_autofilter <complex image in1.cpx> <complex image in2.cpx>
		<complex image out1> <complex image out2> <num of processors>

	<complex image in1.cpx>		Complex Input Image 1
	<complex image in2.cpx>		Complex Input Image 2
	<complex image out1>		Complex Output Image 1
	<complex image out2>		Complex Output Image 2
	<num of processors>		Number of Processors to use

    DESCRIPTION:
		pcpx_autofilter is actually a script that sequentially calls 
	the following programs:

	1.	cpx_spectrum - generates a spectrum for each of the two complex
		images before the filtering

	2.	gen_filt_params - generates the filtering parameter file which
		tells the program pcpx_filter what information to keep and what
		information to throw away.

	3.	pcpx_filter - parallelized version of cpx_filter that is used to
		implement the filtering of the data in azimuth.

	4.	cpx_spectrum - generate a spectrum for each of the two complex
		images after the filtering operation has taken place.

    EXAMPLES:
		
	Suppose that you have two complex images, processed using different
	doppler centroids and you want to increase the coherence of the interferogram.
	The command line to perform this task using pcpx_autofilter is as follows.

		pcpx_autofilter ers1.cpx ers2.cpx ers1_filtered ers2_filtered 8

		This command would produce two complex images, ers1_filtered.cpx and
	ers2_filtered.cpx that have been filtered and basebanded.  One problem with this
	script can occur if the "which" command does not lie in the path on your system.
	The mpirun command fails because it does not find the program pcpx_filter.  The
	user must either modify the pcpx_autofilter script, or add the which command to
	their path.  Modification amounts to simply editing the script and inserting the
	absolute path to the program pcpx_filter as described in the man page for 
	pcpx_filter.
