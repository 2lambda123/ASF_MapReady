Readme for Dump_Multi_Volume:

The dump_multi_volume.valid_dev file has to contain a list of valid tape
drives/device names. The tapes devices accessed have to be those devices
that do not rewind after each access. dump_multi_volume handles all tape
postioning internally. The dump_multi_volume.valid_dev file can be located
in either asf_tools/solaris/bin, asf_tools/sunos/bin, or
asf_tools/src/dump-multi_volume depending upon which form of the tool you
have. Tailor dump_multi_volume.valid_dev to your local system by
altering/adding device names to list all local tape drives. List only one
device per line, with no extraneous characters. 

An example of dump_multi_volume.valid_dev for SunOS:
/dev/nrmt8
/dev/nrsx0

An example of dump_multi_volume.valid_dev for Solaris:
/dev/rmt/1n
