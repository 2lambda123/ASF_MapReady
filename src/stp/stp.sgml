    <para>The latest ASF SAR Training Processor can be downloaded from
       the ASF web site, at http://www.asf.alaska.edu.  On that page,
       select the option to "Get SAR Tools".  This page lists all of
       the tools currently supported by ASF, and you'll see the SAR
       Training Processor (STP) listed there with a link to download
       the tool.  Before downloading, you'll be asked on which
       operating system you intend to run STP.
    </para>
    <para>How you install the tool depends on which operating system
       you selected.  Windows packages come with an installer, Linux
       packages come as an RPM, and Source packages contain source
       code with an autoconf-style configure script.</para>
