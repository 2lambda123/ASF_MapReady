Thank you for trying the ASF convert utility's graphical user interface.

(A) Choosing your files
=======================

There several ways you can add files to the utility.

At this time, your ".D" files must have the same basename as the ".L" files.  So, you won't be specifying the names of the .L files -- just the data files.  The metadata files should be located in the same directory as the data file, and use the same base name.

(1) Specify the source files on the command line.

When you run the utility, you can put a list of files as arguments on the command line.  For example:

Select the file "file1.D":
     asf_convert_gui file1.D

Select all .D files in the current directory:
     asf_convert_gui *.D

Select all .D files in the "data" directory:
     asf_convert gui data/*.D

(2) Use the "Add" button.

After you've run the utility, you can add additional files by typing the name in the textbox next to the "Add" button, and clicking "Add".

(3) Use the "Browse" button.

You can also click "Browse" to pull up a file selection dialog.  Use ctrl-click or shift-click to select more than one file.

(4) Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop files from your file explorer program into the files list, and they will be added.

Clicking "Stop" will stop processing after the current conversion finishes.
