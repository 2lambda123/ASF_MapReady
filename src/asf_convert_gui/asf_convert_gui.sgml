        <title>Choosing Input Files</title>
        <para>There several ways you can add files to the utility.</para>
        <para>
            At this time, your data files must have the same basename as
            the meta-data files.  So, you won't be specifying the names of the
            meta-data files -- just the data files.  The meta-data files
            should be located in the same directory as the data file, and use
            the same base name.
        </para>
        <para>
            For ALOS data, you should choose the leader file (starts
            with LED-), instead of choosing an individual band data
            file.

                <para>
                    When you run the utility, you can put a list of files as
                    arguments on the command line.  For example:
                </para>

                <para>Select the file "file1.D":</para>
                <para>asf_convert_gui file1.D</para>

                <para>Select all .D files in the current directory:</para>
                <para>asf_convert_gui *.D</para>

                <para>Select all LED-* files in the current directory:</para>
                <para>asf_convert_gui LED-*</para>

                <para>Select all .D files in the "data" directory:</para>
                <para>asf_convert_gui data/*.D</para>

                </para>
                <para>
                    Files exist in data and metadata pairs.  The file you
                    should select is the data file (such as .D), and
                    not the metadata (such as .L).
                </para>
                <para>
                    For ALOS data, there is one metadata file (LED-*)
                    and one or more image files (IMG-*).  There is one
                    image file for each band in the input data.

                    The default, "CEOS (Level 1)" is the most common format.
                    For the STF format, you have the option of restricting

        <title>DEM</title>

        <para>
            If you have a digital elevation model (DEM) available for the
            scene, you can use this DEM to refine the geolocation of the
            SAR data, or to perform terrain correction.
        </para>
        <para>
            Terrain correction necessarily involves geolocation refinement
            as well.  The terrain correction process alters the data in
            the SAR image, attempting to correct for the side-looking
            geometry of SAR.
        </para>
        <para>
            Geolocation refinement doesn't affect the image data, however
            the image's metadata values are adjusted in order to improve 
            geolocation.  The specific metadata fields that are updated 
            are "slant_shift" and "time_shift".
        </para>
        <para>
            DEMs may be provided in either the ASF internal format, or as
            a GeoTIFF.  If the given DEM is a GeoTIFF, it is converted
            into ASF internal format prior to terrain correction.
        </para>
        <para>
            GeoTIFF DEMs can be downloaded from the USGS Seamless site,
            http://seamless.usgs.gov.  You will need to change the format
            of the downloaded DEM to GeoTIFF.  ASF provides a command-line
            utility "akdem_grab" which will download GeoTIFFs from the
            seamless site for you.

        <para>
            Checking the DEM checkbox indicates that you do have a DEM
            available for the scene(s) you are processing.  Note that at
            this time a single DEM must apply to all of the scenes.

                    Some DEMs have holes in them; this is particularly
                    a problem with SRTM DEMs.  If this is the case,
                    the terrain corrected product will often contain
                    streaks in the areas near the holes.  You can fill
                    the holes with interpolated values prior to
                    terrain correction with this option, which will
                    reduce or even eliminate these streaks. However,
                    you should still expect suboptimal results within
                    the holes.

                    Refining the geolocation doesn't change the image data,
                    only the metadata is adjusted.  Terrain correction also
                    applies geolocation refinement, and corrects the image data
                    for the side-looking SAR geometry.

                <para>
                    The default is terrain correction.  Some of the following

                <para>
                    If you wish, you may use masking to improve geolocation
                    refinement and/or terrain correction.  For many scenes this
                    won't be necessary; in general, it is only necessary if
                    the scene contains large areas that won't correlate well
                    with the DEM.  For example, water bodies provide very poor
                    correlation.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Using a mask means that the geolocation refinement only
                    utilizes portions of the image you think will yield good
                    correlation.
                </para>
                <para>
                    You can either provide a mask file yourself, or have one
                    automatically generated for you.  An automatically generated
                    mask masks out regions of the DEM at 1m or less (the water
                    regions).  A mask that you provide should have the value 0
                    in regions that provide good correlation, and 1 (or any
                    positive value) where the correlation is expected to be poor.

                <para>
                    Enter in the desired pixel size of the terrain corrected
                    image.  This option doesn't apply to geolocation refinement
                    without terrain correction, since in this case the image
                    data is not changed.
                </para>
                <para>
                    If you do not enter a pixel size, the pixel size in the input
                    SAR image will be retained -- unless the DEM image has a much
                    larger pixel size than the SAR image, in which case your SAR
                    image will be downsampled to have a pixel size of half that
                    of the DEM.  For example, if the SAR image has 12.5 meter pixels,
                    and the DEM has 60 meter pixels, the terrain correction processing
                    will downsample your SAR data to 30 meters.

                <para>
                    If you do specify a pixel size, your requested value will be used
                    even though you are limited to the accuracy of the DEM.  For
                    example, if the SAR image has 12.5 meter pixels, and the DEM has
                    60 meter pixels, and you specify a 12.5 meter pixel size, that
                    value will be used even though your terrain corrected result will
                    be oversampled.
                </para>
                <para>
                    This value differs from the value specified in on the geocoding
                    section in that here your main concern is the difference between
                    the SAR and DEM pixel sizes, whereas the pixel size specified on
                    the geocode tab is the pixel size you want in the output data.

                    it isn't possible to recover the actual backscatter values in
                    the layover regions.  However, doing so does produce a nicer looking

            Turning Geocoding on will invoke the "asf_geocode" utility

            Each projection has a "User Defined" option, where the
            parameters for the projection are specified manually.  Some
            projections have some built-in parameters selections.  You can

            If you use one of the predefined projections, you may
            get some projection errors that will cause asf_geocode
            to quit, since asf_geocode uses fairly strict accuracy requirements.
            If asf_geocode reports that your projection errors are
            too large, you can either use asf_geocode from the command
            line and specify the "--force" option, or you can choose
            a User Defined projection, and adjust the projection

            Azimuthal Equal Area.  Each projection requires one or more
            additional items.

            The geocoding process necessarly involves a resampling of
            the original data.  For each pixel in the geocoded image, the
            location of that pixel is projected back to a location in the
            original image.  The pixels in the original image nearest to
            this location are then resampled to produce the value of the
            pixel in the geocoded image.  This resampling is done using
            the method selected in the "Resampling Method" dropdown
            list.

                    Selects the method used to resample the data.  In the
                    geocoding process, the pixel values in the geocoded image are
                    determined by locating the corresponding point in the
                    original, and resampling the original image pixels
                    closest to this point.  "Nearest Neighbor" simply selects
                    the pixel closest to the point, "Bilinear" does linear
                    interpolation between the nearest pixels, and "Bicubic"
                    fits a cubic spline through the nearest pixels.  The
                    bicubic method is the most accurate, however it is also
                    the slowest, and can also have the effect of low-pass

                    version by right-clicking and selecting "View
                    Image".  The output image will also enlarge when
                    hovered over with the mouse.

                    By default, the tool stores the generated files in the
                    same directory as the input files.  Here you may specify a
                    different directory if you prefer.
                </para>

                <para>
                    By default, the output files are put into the same
                    directory as the input files.  If this is a read-only
                    directory (such as a CD), you will need to change the
                    output directory!)

                    This is a useful option if you're going to be generating
                    more than one output file, each using different
                    parameters.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, you may wish to generate Amplitude and
                    Power images for each of your input files.  Or, you may want
                    to project each file into more than one projection.

                <para>
                    The "Prefix" and "Suffix" strings are applied to each
                    output filename (except those you've changed manually).  So,
                    you can process the data once with your first set of
                    settings (e.g., "Amplitude" selected in the Radiometry
                    section) using the suffix "_amp", and then a second time
                    with another set of settings (i.e., "Power" selected in the
                    Radiometry section) using the suffix "_pwr".

        <para>The "Execute" button starts the processing.</para>

        <para>
            The processing starts with the first file in the list, and
            processes each in turn until the last file in the list.
        </para>

        <para>
            Files marked as "Done" will not be processed again if you
            click "Stop" and then click "Execute" again.  In other words,
            clicking "Execute" picks up processing from where it left off.
            However, if you've changed any settings (specifically, anything
            that appears in the "Summary" section) the processing will again
            start from the beginning.
        </para>

        <para>
            Clicking "Stop" will stop processing.  It may take a
            moment or two for the processing to stop.
        </para>

        <para>
            If any of the output files already exist (i.e., they are
            shown in red in the files list), you will need to confirm that
            you don't mind overwriting those files.  If you do mind, please
            change the output file name before starting processing, or
            rename the original output file.
        </para>

        <para>
            As the processing proceeds, the asf_import, asf_terrcorr,
            asf_geocode, and asf_export tools are invoked for each
            file. (Unless the tool hasn't been selected, of course.)
            These tools generate output messages which are captured by the
            tool and displayed in the terminal window that is opened
            along with the GUI.  This logging information is also
            available by clicking the "View Log" option.
        </para>

        <para>
            If an error occurs during the processing of a file, instead
            of "Done" in the status column, you'll see "Error".  You can
            then right-click and select "View Log", to read the details
            of the error.

        <title>Toolbar Buttons</title>

        <para>
            Just above each files section is a set of toolbar buttons.
            To use the buttons, select one or more files in the files
            grid, and then click on the button you wish to use.  Some
            button work with only one file, others work with more than
            one selected.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you right-click on a row in the files grid, a menu will
            appear with the same options available in the toolbar.
            These options will apply to the file
            in the row that is selected.  Some options may be disabled, in
            some circumstances.

                    completion, the file is moved to the "Completed

                    The ASF CEOS Metadata Viewer
                    program will be used to view the metadata for the file.
                    It operates on the CEOS .L file instead of ASF's .meta
                    file.
