    NAME: sr2gr - converts slant range images to ground range images

    SYNOPSIS:	sr2gr <infile> <outfile> <pixsiz>

       infile     base name (.img,.meta)
       outfile    base name (.img,.meta)
       pixsiz     output pixel spacing (meters)


    DESCRIPTION:

	This program converts slant range imagery into ground range
	imagery.  The algorithm calculates the ground range to the
        first pixel in the image and from the spacecraft ephemeris,
	earth ellipsoid, and slant range to first pixel given in the
	image's metadata.  It then uses the slant range spacing interval
	to determine appropriate ground range positions.  The remapping
	is performed using bi-linear interpolation.
