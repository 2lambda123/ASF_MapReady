Explanation for why WGS-84 is utilized for defining ITRF-xx semi-major and
inverse flattening values:

From the explanation given in the "EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF
AIR NAVIGATION", Appendix B, Section B.5 (the most succinct explanation of
major/minor values v. ITRF-xx):

"International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF):
An accurate geodetic reference frame that consists of a globally distributed
network of survey stations whose positions and velocities are determined by
several independent measurement technologies (GPS, satellite laser ranging, very
long baseline interferometry and the French DORIS system). Positions and
velocities are published periodically by the IERS, and each published set is
identified by the epoch of the station positions. Thus, the published position of a
point in ITRF97 is valid at the epoch 1st January 1997, whereas the position of the
point at some future time must take into account the effect of the pointÂ’s velocity.
The ITRF uses the same system parameters as WGS-84, and is the most
accurate realisation of WGS-84 that is available."

Obviously far more information on the ITRS and ITRFs exists, but they all state
that the base spheroid used for ITRS is the GRS-1980 spheroid / WGS-84 datum.  I
just think that the paragraph above captures the gist of things in the briefest
manner and is therefore suitable as a comment here.
