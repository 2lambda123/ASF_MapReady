README File for sarview, a Tcl/Tk SAR image viewing program

To build sarview, you'll need Tcl/Tk 8.1 installed on
your machine (the shared-library version).  You may
need to edit the XHOME and TK_DIR variables in this
program's Makefile to match the location of 
your Tk and X11 include files and libraries.

You'll also need to have the asf_meta, asf_las, asf,
and libjpeg standard ASF-STEP libraries built.
This should happen by default.
