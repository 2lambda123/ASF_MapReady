NAME:
	pigram - create an interferogram from the two input images 
	         with multiple processors.

SYNOPSIS:
	pigram imageA imageB outfile [-log <file>]

DESCRIPTION:
	pigram creates an interferogram from the two sets of input
	images, this is done exactly like igram, except that multiple
	processors are used.  imageA and imageB are the base names of 
	two files with extensions .amp and .phase.  The .amp & .phase
	extensions will be appended to the input names, so they must 
	be omitted.
	
	The output file, outfile, is the multiplication of the 
	amplitude and phase of imageA and the complex conjugate of 
	imageB.  The product will be split into two parts, phase and
	amplitude, and placed in seperate files.  The phase file 
	(which has the extension .phase) is the interferogram's phase
	which still retains the remaping effects produced by the Earth's
	curvature. The amp file (which has the extension .amp) is the 
	amplitude file.

	This is the central, critical program in the interferometry 
	process.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
	imageA First complex image file. (*.cpx, *.ddr). Igram
		adds any extensions.

	imageB Second complex image file. (*.cpx, *.ddr). Igram
		adds any extensions.

	outfile Base name of amplitude and phase file to store 
		interferogram.

ERROR MESSAGES:
MESSAGE GIVEN:				REASON:
------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:
	example% pigram a b ifm_ab

	Calculates an interferogram from the input files a.cpx and
	b.cpx. The amplitude and phase are stored in ifm_ab.amp and
	ifm_ab.phase.
