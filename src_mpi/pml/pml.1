.TH pml 1 "Sept 2000"
.SH NAME:
pml \- convert an interferogram's .amp & .phase files into an image.
.SH SYNOPSIS:
.B "pml"
[-l \fIl\fPx\fIl\fP | -n metafile] [-a] [-x <file>]
.BI "<interferogram> <outfile>"
.SH DESCRIPTION:
.B "pml"
(multilook) is a low pass filter which also makes the image square (i.e. 
makes the aspect ratio equal to one).  It does this by performing a box 
average on some number of pixels.
.PP
For ERS-1, and ERS-2, this box should be 5 pixels in azimuth
by 1 pixel in range in order to produce nearly square pixels (This is the default).
For JRS, the box should be 3x1 pixels.
For RADARSAT, the box should be 3x1 for most beams, but 1x1 for fine beam.
.PP
In
.B "pml,"
look area is defined using option switches, but has default values of 1
col (1 pixel in range) and 5 rows (5 pixels in azimuth).  The look area
defines how much input data will be used to determine the value of one
pixel in the output data. 
.PP
To calculate multilooked amplitude, add the square of each amplitude value
in look area.  Divide by the number of amplitude entries and take square
root of this value.  To calculate multilooked phase, add all the real
parameters of each entry in look area. Then add all the imaginary
parameters of each entry in look area. Take atan2() of imag over real. 
.PP
Multilook creates an amp, phase, and a corresponding LAS image file
including a DDR file. The image file has byte data in 3 bands. The first
band corresponds to red, the second to green, and the third to blue. The
bands are in sequential order. 
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
.TP 8
.B "-l \fIl\fPx\fIl\fP"
Change the height (azimuth size) and width (range size) of the look box. Default is 5x1.
.TP 8
.B "-n metafile"
Use the nLooks given in the specified meta file.  Sets looks box to nLooks x 1.
.TP 8
.B "-a"
Produce a color phase image _las.img without the amplitude added in.
.TP 8
.B "-x <file>"
Allows the output to be written to a log file.
.TP 8
.B "<interferogram>"
Input interferogram files (.amp, .phase, .ddr). Usually the output of igram(1).
.TP 8
.B "<outfile>"
Output image (.amp, .phase, .img, .ddr).
.B "Ml"
creates a LAS 6.0 image with a corresponding DDR that can be displayed. 
All extensions are automatically added.

.B MESSAGE_GIVEN: REASON:
-------------------------------------------------------------
.SH EXAMPLES:
.ce 1
example% ml ifm1 fred
.PP
Multilook the amplitude and phase files ifm1.amp and ifm1.phase using
image dimensions in ifm1.ddr, and store the results in fred.img, 
fred.ddr, fred.amp and fred.phase.
.PP
.ce 1
example% ml -l 10x2 ifm1 fred
.PP
Same as above except change the look area to 10 rows and 2 cols.
