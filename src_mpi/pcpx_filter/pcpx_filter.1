    NAME:	pcpx_filter - Parallelized complex image bandpass filter

    SYNOPSIS:	pcpx_filter <complex image input.cpx> <complex image output>
		<frequency parameter file>

	<complex image input.cpx>	Input Complex Image
	<complex image output>		Output Complex Image
	<frequency parameter file>	File containing passband information

    DESCRIPTION:
		Complex images are usually processed using an optimal doppler,
	which is ideal for that particular image.  This means that when 
	interferometry is attempted with two different complex images, the 
	azimuthal spectra will not overlap completely.  The part the spectra 
	that is outside	the overlapping bands contributes noise in the resulting
	inteferogram.  The overall phase coherence of the interferogram can be 
	improved by removing the components of the azimuthal spectrum 
	which do not overlap.
		This program takes a complex image as input and using the filter
	parameters generated by the program gen_filt_params, it filters the
	data in azimuth.  This program also applies a frequency shift to the 
	data specified in the filter parameter file.

    EXAMPLES:
	Suppose you have an input image ers1.cpx, then to filter the data,
	the command line input would be:
	
	    mpirun -np 8 `which pcpx_filter` ers1.cpx ers1 params

	The complicated command line interface is required for runnning 
	software that uses the mpi libraries.  The switch -np defines the number
	of processors to be used and the `which pcpx_filter` simply defines the 
	program being called by using its entire path.  You could also just use
	/3dsar1/mayers/asf_tools/bin/irix/pcpx_filter, but `which pcpx_filter` is
	easier to type.
