NAME:  swath_offset 

SYNOPSIS:
 
	swath_offset <1.meta> <2.meta> <1.par> <2.par> <out_file>
			[ -lat <lat> <lon> -log <file> -quiet] 

DESCRIPTION:

	This program calculates the start and end lines of each	swath
        and outputs the start & end lines for each swath.
	
	This program calculates the line offsets for two overlapping 
	level zero swath images.  The output is a file that contains the 
	start and end lines for each image, and the number of patches that
	 both cover.

OPTIONS:

 	<1.meta> is the first .meta file of the pair being compared
	<2.meta> is the second .meta file of the pair being compared
 	<1.par> is the first .par file of the pair being compared
	<2.par> is the second .par file of the pair being compared
	<out_file> is the output file generated by swath_offset
        [-lat <lat> <lon>] allows lat/lon constraints
        [-log <file>] allows the output to be written to a log file
        [-quiet] suppresses the output to the essential
