  In this directory, you'll find several utilities
for manipulating files full of state vectors.  Specifically,
you'll find routines for converting ASF-DADS format
state vector files (both pre- and post-1996 format) back
into the original ESA and NASDA flight agency formats.

  The ESA converter definetly works well; since we've 
sucessfully run the Vexcel LZP on its output.  The 
NASDA converter is not definetly OK-- we think the format
is right; but we cannot get the Vexcel LZP to accept
its output (the jury is still out, however).

  To build this software sucessfully, you'll have to
have already built the geolocate library (for fixed2gei
and gei2fixed state vector conversion routines), the
asf_sar library (for byte-order conversion routines) and
the caplib library (for FOPEN and FREAD routines
which carefully check return codes and produce their
own error messages).  The programs should be compile and
run sucessfully on any platform (big or little endian, 
4 or 8 byte integers) but have only been tested on big-endian
4-byte int systems.

  In general, the programs accept a single ASF-DADS 
state vector file, and produce a single agency-format
state vector file.

  The binaries are:
stVec_ers 
stVec_ers_dump 
  These create and display ESA-format state vector files.

stVec_jers 
stVec_jers_dump
  These create and display NASDA-format state vector files.
