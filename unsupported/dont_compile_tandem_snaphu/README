This directory has sat dormant for quite some time. Perhaps it is completely
useless, but it seems prudent to keep it around for an excessive amount of time
before completely doing away with it. The binaries you'll find in the two
subdirectories (snaphu and tandem_ifm_snaphu) were created on an IRIX64 6.5
(on an Origin 2000) system. It was moved here
(unsupported/dont_compile_tandem_snaphu) in February 2003 from its original
location in asf_tools/src_akdem/DO_NOT_COMPILE_THIS_CODE .
The snaphu source was never actually maintained by us, it was written by Curtis
Chen. Check out http://www-star.stanford.edu/sar_group/snaphu.
