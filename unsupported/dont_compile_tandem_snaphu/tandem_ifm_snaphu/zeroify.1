NAME:  zeroify - utility used inside tandem_ifm

SYNOPSIS: zeroify  <input image> <test image> <output image>
      All images are arbitrary one-banded LAS images.
      The input and test images must exist.

DESCRIPTION:

	Zeroify creates an output image which is identical to
the input image, but zero wherever the test image is zero.
This is used in dem-guided phase unwrapping, in tandem_ifm.

That is, for each pixel:
	if the test image is zero, the output is zero;
	otherwise, set the output image to the input image.
