NAME: Las_text

SYNOPSIS:

  las_text  [-z <sz>]  [-t <txtclr>] [-b <bgclr>] [-l <line> [-s <sample>]
  	    <in> <out> <txt>


DESCRIPTION:
	
	Writes the given text string on top of a LAS image.
	This is useful in preparing scientific illustrations.
	The procedure works with any single-banded image (e.g., byte, short, 
	float...).
    
ARGUMENTS:

  <in>    Single-band LAS input image.

  <out>	  Output image.

  <txt>   is the text to be printed.  This can only be one line,
          but can contain any combination of uppercase, lowercase, 
          numbers, or the punctuation .,;?/\().

OPTIONS:

  -z <sz>     is the height of the text, in pixels (default is 9).  Note that
              the text can only scale in 9-pixel increments, so the size will
              rounded to the nearest multiple of 9 (9,18,27,36...).  There
              is no upper limit to the text size.
	
  -t <txtclr> Text Color is the numeric value in which the letters of the 
	      text will be drawn.  The default is 0 (black).

  -b <bgclr>  bg color is the numeric value in which the space immediately around 
	      the letters of the text will be drawn.  The default is 255
	      (white).

  -l <line>   is the location of the center sameple of the text.  
 	          The default is the image center.

  -s <sample> is the location of the center sameple of the text.  
 	          The default is the image center.

    
EXAMPLES:
	las_text in.img out.img "12345"

	This reads the image "in.img", overlays the numbers "12345" 
	in black atop a white background in the image center, and writes the
	result to "out.img".
