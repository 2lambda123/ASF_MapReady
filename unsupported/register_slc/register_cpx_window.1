NAME: register_cpx_window

SYNOPSIS: 

	register_cpx_window <file1> <file2> <igram> <start line> 
			    <start sample> <height> <width> 
          		    [<grid resolution>[-sinc[-warp]]]

DESCRIPTION: 
  
  Register_cpx_window will cut a window, or section, out of 
  the two input images, then run register_cpx to make
  an interferogram out of them.
  After this, interferometry can be done using tandem_ifm.

  The register scripts automate the process of interferogram
  generation for four data types:
  CPX (register_cpx), windowed CPX (register_cpx_window), 
  SIC (register_slc), and windowed (or trimmed) SIC (register_slc_window).
  CPX refers to IEEE 32-bit floating-point complex data (.cpx and .ddr)
  SIC refers to ASF's Single Int Complex data (.D and .L, or .dat and .ldr).
  
  After running this script you have an interferogram, which
  you can view with ml, generate a DEM with tandem_ifm(1), or
  use for your own science.
  An estimate of the baseline is written to base.00.

OPTIONS:

  <file1>  a complex file (.cpx, .ddr, and .L or .ldr)
  <file2>  a complex file (.cpx, .ddr)
  <igram>  the output interferogram (.amp, .phase, .ddr)
  <start line>,<start sample> define the vertical and horizontal
           coordinates of the top left corner of the desired section.
  <heigth>,<width> define the height and width of the output images.
  [<grid resolution>] is the grid resolution for fico(1).
           (the default is 20, for a 20x20 grid)
  [-sinc]  use Sinc kernel to do the remapping-- this is 
           slower, but may result in higher quality.
           The default is bilinear interpolation.
  [-warp]  create and use a non-linear warping image instead
           of a linear planar map.  See fit_warp(1).
