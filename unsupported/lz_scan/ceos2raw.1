    NAME: ceos2raw

    SYNOPSIS: ceos2raw <input CEOS signal> <output> [ <beamNo> ]


    DESCRIPTION:
	ceos2raw converts the given CEOS signal data file into
an AISP-compatible raw format.  It extracts the necessary processing
parameters (slant range, prf, satellite mode) from the satellite
headers, which it copiously outputs during processing.  It extracts
state vectors from the CEOS platform position data record.

The currently supported CEOS formats are:
	-ESA CCSD CEOS data
	-VEXCEL RSA-compatible CEOS signal data

ASF CCSD data can be read directly by AISP and quicklook.


The currently supported satellites are:
	-ERS-1 and ERS-2
	-JERS
	-RADARSAT, all beams & modes (including SCANSAR)


    OPTIONS:
	beamNo: for SCANSAR data, the number of the
beam to write out.  The default is beam 0, the first
beam.  This parameter exists because AISP and quicklook
cannot handle multiple beams at once-- the beams must
be processed individually.


    EXAMPLES:
	> ceos2raw RSAT_02.D format_02.raw
	Converts the CEOS signal data file RSAT_02 into the
AISP raw input file format_02.raw.  This file can later
be SAR processed using "aisp format_02.raw aisp_02" or
"quicklook format_02.raw quick_02".

	> ceos2raw RSAT_12.D beam2.raw 2
	Extract beam number 2 (the third beam) from the
SCANSAR CEOS file RSAT_12.  Produces AISP raw input file 
beam2.raw, which only contains pulses from beam 2.


    BUGS:
Does not compensate for skipped lines. 
Output is very inefficient for SCANSAR images.  
SCANSAR images cannot be quicklooked.
