Instructions for using RELAX4.FOR on a Unix machine (some modifications
to the instructions may be necessary for non-Unix machine):

Step 1. Compile RELAX4.FOR to create an executable version of RELAX4.FOR.

Step 2. Create (in the same directory as the executable version of RELAX4.FOR) 
ascii file RELAX4.INP containing the problem data in RELAX-IV format.  
[The first line of RELAX4.INP 
should contain n (the number of nodes) and m (the number of arcs); the 
next m lines should contain the starting node, ending node, cost, and 
upper capacity (lower capacity is assumed to be zero) for each arc; 
the last n lines should contain the supply for each node.  See the  
RELAX4.INP file included with the package for an example.]

Step 3. Run the executable version of RELAX4.FOR.  [You will be asked by 
the code to enter either 0 (for default initialization) or 1 (for auction 
initialization).  
Either initialization will solve the problem and, for most problems, we 
recommend using the default initialization for faster solution time.  If 
the code with default initialization takes a long time to solve the 
problem, then try running the code with the auction initialization instead.]
