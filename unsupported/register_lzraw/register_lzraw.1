NAME: register_lzraw

SYNOPSIS:

   register_lzraw <file 1> <file 2> <igram_out> 
		[-g <grid_resolution>]
		[-line <start_line1> <start_line2> <end_line1> <end_line2>]
		[-lat <start_lat> <end_lat>]
		[-p [<num_processors>]]
		[-f]
		[-ml]
		[-nolz2raw]

   <file 1>  is a level zero swath file
   <file 2>  is a second level zero swath file
   <igram_out>  is the name of the output interferogram

DESCRIPTION:

	register_lzraw automates the process of sub-pixel
  registration for ASF Level-Zero Swath data.  This program will take
  this data, cut it into pieces of matching location, and size, SAR process it,
  sub-pixel register it, and make it into an interferogram.  The result will 
  be an inteferogram. After this, you can generate a DEM with tandem_ifm.

OPTIONS:   

   [-g <grid_resolution] specifies a grid resolution to pass to fico
   [-line <start_line1> <start_line2> <end_line2> <end_line2>]
	   constrains the swaths to the given lines
   [-lat <start_lat> <end_lat>] specifies a start and end
	   latitude to constrian the swath images
   [-p [<num_processors>] specifies to use parallel versions of
	   programs if possible. If no number of processors is
	   specified, 8 are used.
   [-f]    passes the -f switch to fico for fft matching.
   [-ml]   automatically multi-looks the interferogram.
   [-nolz2raw]  Option to disable call to lz2raw_flywheel, assumes input 
	   are APD raw format.
