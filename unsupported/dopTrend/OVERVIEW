OVERVIEW of ASF-STEP OPS TOOLS:

	In the STEP lab, we've developed two tools for use in ASF 
Operations: dopPlot and write_dlt.  
	
	Both of these utilities run from the UNIX command line on the 
Apollo machine.  DopPlot finds and corrects doppler PRF ambiguities in 
RADARSAT Data for the RAMP project using a "doppler trend" approach.  
Write_dlt concatenates and writes to a Digital Linear Tape all the 
order directories on Apollo.


SPECIFICS of dopPlot:

	To determine which dopplers are bad in the entire set of order 
directories, log into Apollo as operator, and type:

	cd ~/amm_DLT_write/run/
	dopPlotOrder

	This will plot the dopplers for each revolution present in the 
order directires, determine (if it can) the bad frames, write out a 
Processing Parameter File (PPF) for each bad frame, and send a list of 
bad frames off to Martha Mason for re-ordering.
	
	Once Martha Mason re-orders the bad frames, the Precision 
Processor will automatically see the PPF (containing the correct 
doppler) and re-process the image correctly.  This process may need to 
be repeated until no new frames need to be re-ordered.
	
	Once all the frames have good dopplers, a DLT can be prepared 
containing all the frames.  This DLT will be shipped off to Ohio 
State, where the RAMP project will continue.


SPECIFICS of write_dlt:

	To create a DLT containing all the frames in all the order 
directories on Apollo, log into Apollo as operator, and type:
	
	cd ~/amm_DLT_write/run/
	write_dlt ramp
	
	Write_dlt will guide you through the tape-writing process, 
prompting for tape change, and asking if you want to print a list of 
the contents, send the contents list to Martha Mason, and when done, 
asks if you'd like to remove the written frames.
