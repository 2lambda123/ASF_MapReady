  <li> FAIF_encrypt is an application program for encrypting passwords which
must be executed prior to activating all FAIF.  File transfer operations,
particularly those involving FTP, shall decrypt the files as necessary.
Below is a usage summary.

</ol>
<p>
Usage:<br> <pre>
    >$FAIF_BINPATH/FAIF_encrypt -i <i>interface</i>  </pre>
where <i>interface</i> is the interface for which the password information 
is intended.  Below are valid values for <i>interface</i>.  After giving the
<b>FAIF_encrypt</b> command, you will be prompted for the username and 
password. <pre>

    ESA          - FAIF to ESA (Requires the ESA username and password)
    NASDA        - FAIF/NASDA  for inbound and outbound files 
                   (Requires the NASDA username and password)
    WALPS        - FAIF to Wallops (Requires the Wallops username and password)
    CSA_ufdrf_F  - FAIF/CSA UFDRF  for Fairbanks inbound and outbound

                   (Requires the appropriate CSA username and password)

</pre>

<p>
FAIF_encrypt encrypts username and password information entered
interactively and stores the encrypted information in a file.  Encrypted
files are decrypted by the FAIF when file transfer is initiated.

2. The environment variable <a href="FAIF.html#01">FAIF_ROOTPATH</a> must be set prior to executing
FAIF_encrypt and its value must be the same as the value used when
executing all other FAIF components.  Note as well that the FAIF 
directories must be set up as described in the FAIF Instructions page.

<hr>
3. Note that once a password file has been created for a specific interface,
a user is not allowed to keep on re-executing FAIF_encrypt to replace its
contents.  The FAIF directory where password files are found has to be
cleaned up prior to re-entering a different username and password.  The
FAIF directory containing password files must be cleaned up by a user
with the appropriate permissions.
