<a name="01"><p><b>1.</b>  Locating and reading the FAIF syslog </a>

<p>
The FAIF operator's .cshrc file should contain the following line: <pre>
  <b>  >source syslog_aliases.csh </b> 

</pre>
This establishes the alias $SYS_LOG_NAME for the syslog filename and several 
aliases to help you browse the log.  To list only the latest segment of the 
syslog, use:<pre>
  <b>  >tail_log </b>

</pre>
To load a copy of the FAIF syslog into an emacs editor window, use: <pre>
  <b>  >ed_log </b>

</pre>
To use some other editor or browser with the FAIF syslog, use the $SYS_LOG_NAME
alias.

<p>
Each line begins with the date and time, the machine name, the program name,
and the process ID.  This is usually followed by the severity indication 
(NOTICE, WARNING, etc.) and the text of the log message.

<p>
Errors and warnings in syslog are the best starting point when <a href="trouble_shoot.html">trouble-shooting

<a name="02"><b>2.</b>  syslog messages for dirmon activity </a>

<p>
In the nominal case, the log messages from FAIF dirmon programs will follow
this outline to handle one file: <pre>

  Establishing a semaphore.
  "Routing file <i>filename</i>."
  Processing and possible translation, according to filetype.
  IMS archive ("added" or "replaced") for the file and any translation files.
  Adding file to file list log.
  "Routed <i>filename</i>."
  "No files in file list."

</pre>
<p>
When the directory being monitored has more than 1 file, the syslog lines from
"Routing file <i>filename</i>" to "Routed <i>filename</i>" will be repeated for
each file.  Finally, the message "No files in file list" indicates that every
file in the directory has been processed.

<p> 
<hr>
<a name="03"><b>3.</b>  syslog messages for CSAgetfile activity</a>
<p>
In the nominal case, the log messages from CSAgetfile will follow this outline:
<pre>

  Establishing a semaphore
  Normal child process termination, exit status = 0
  Normal termination obtaining or checking for <i>file type</i> from <i>remote host</i>.
  Normal child process termination, exit status = 0
  Routing file <i>filename</i>.
  Processing and possible translation, according to filetype.
  IMS archive ("replacement") for the file and any translation files.
  Adding file to file list log.
  Routed <i>filename</i>.
  Destroyed semaphore...  

</pre>
<p>
When there is more than 1 file of the specified file type, the syslog lines from
"Routing file <i>filename</i>" to "Routed <i>filename</i>" will be repeated for
each file.  

<p> 
<hr>
<a name="04"><b>4.</b>  syslog messages for FAxmit activity</a>
<p>
In the nominal case, the log messages from FAxmit will look like this:
<pre>

  Server entry ... is listening for remote procedure calls.
  Normal child process termination, exit status = 0.
  Successfully transferred <i>filename</i> to <i>destination</i>.

</pre>
