<a name="01"><p><b>1.</b>  Listing and reading a crontab file </a>

<p>
Use the command <pre>
  <b>  >crontab -l </b> </pre>
to list the active crontab file.

<p>
Each line consists of a program execution schedule followed by the 
string which will be executed by the shell at the specified time(s).
Lines that begin with <b>#</b> are comment lines and are ignored by the cron
daemon.

<p>
The first five items on the line are: <pre>
    minute (0-59) 
    hour (0-23) 
    day of the month (1-31) 
    month of the year (1-12) 
    day of the week (0-6 with 0=Sunday)  
</pre>
Any of these may be an asterisk, meaning all legal values.  These five
items must be separated by spaces or tabs.  The items may also be ranges
(such as 2-5) or sequences (such as 0,15,30,45)
    
<p>
For example, this line: <br>
<pre>
    <b>  16 03,09,15,21 * * * /asf/bin/CSAgetfile_all.csh </b> 

</pre>
will run the shell script CSAgetfile_all.csh at 3:16am, 9:16am, 3:16pm,
and 9:16pm every day.

<a name="02"><b>2.</b>  Editing and replacing a crontab file </a>

<p>
Use the command <pre>
   <b>  >crontab -l > <i>crontab.sav</i> </b> </pre>
to save a copy of the current active crontab file in crontab.sav.

<p>
Use the command <pre>
   <b>  >crontab <i>new_crontab_filename</i> </b> </pre>
to make new_crontab_filename become the active crontab file.

<p>
Use the command <pre>
   <b>  >setenv EDITOR <i>my_favorite_editor</i> </b> </pre>
to establish the editor you wish to use when working on the active 
crontab file (should you choose to do so).

<p>
Use the command <pre>
   <b>  >crontab -e </b> </pre>
to edit the active crontab file, using the editor specified in the EDITOR
environment variable.

<p>
<a name="03"><b>3.</b>   Managing alternate crontab files </a>

<p>
You may wish to make certain changes, perhaps repeatedly, to the
scheduled FAIF program execution.  Perhaps one external agency is 
only sporadically available.  Or the communication link to another
will be down for a week.  Or due to personnel vacation schedules, 
certain FAIF jobs must be deferred for a time.  Or some FAIF
software is about to be upgraded.

<p>
As an alternative to repeatedly editing the active crontab file, you
may decide to keep copies of several alternate crontab files ready for
use.  These files may have been created from scratch, or from editing 
the default crontab file, /local/faif/crontab.default, or from editing
and then saving a copy of the active crontab file.

<p>
To save a copy of the active crontab file, use a command like: <pre>
   <b>  >crontab -l > <i>crontab_file_full_version</i> </b> </pre>

<p>
To make another file become the active crontab file, use a command like: <pre>
   <b>  >crontab <i>crontab_file_no_CSA</i> </b> </pre>
