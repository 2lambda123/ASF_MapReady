=============================== PPS Release 2.1 ==============================

I. New functionalities:

	1. Upon receiving a SPS Job Status messages with RETRY status,
	   update the job status and send IMS Order Status message with
	   status RETRY.
	2. Upon receivng a SPS Job Status messages with CANCEL/FAIL status,
	   send IMS Order Status message with status FAILED.  If the Order
	   Status message is successfully sent to the IMS, delete the job
	   from the PPS database, otherwise keep the job in status CANCEL/FAIL.

II. PR fixed:

   	1. PR 2550: IMS Order Status message needs to be sent for a job which
	            is unplanned (state change from AVAILABLE to READY) 
	2. PR 2512: PPS fails to search the entire PLANNED queue to satisfy a
	            a CP job request for a specific type.
	3. ASF 693: The pps_server_debug writes several tens of MBs of NUL 
	            characters at the head of the PPSrun.log file upon its first
	            write to the file.
	4. PR xxxx: A float value should be accepted as a search value for 
	            pixel_spacing on the PPS GUI Query window. 

III. Operational changes:

	The PPS_startserver.csh was modified to make use of the script
	$ASF/bin/wrt_PPSrunlog.sh which is maintained and delivered by FAIF.
	The fix for PR 693 described above requires the outputs generated from
	the PPS Server to be piped to the script wrt_PPSrunlog.sh, which allows
	the PPSrun.log to be rotated properly without producing extraneous NUL 
	characters.  

	When the PPS_startserver.csh script is invoked with -d option, stdout and
	stderr will be redirected to the file "/LOCAL/pps/logs/PPSrun.log".  

IV. Special notes for testing:

	The problem described in PR 693 can only be reproduced when the PPSrun.log
	is rotated by the system log rotate script while the PPS Server is up.
	To test this PR: 
	    - Start the PPS Server using the PPS_startserver.csh script
	      with -d option. 
	    - Request Sevak to execute the system log rotate script on 
	      /LOCAL/pps/logs/PPSrun.log while the PPS Server is up.
	    - Invoke any RPC which triggers the Server to write to PPSrun.log
	      and verify that no NUL characters are inserted at the head of
	      the file.
