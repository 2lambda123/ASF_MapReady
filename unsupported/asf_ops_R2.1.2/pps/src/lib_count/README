This directory contains the routines for the internal PPS statistics
gathering routines.  These routines are for internal use only, and it
is probably best to refer to them as debug routines.

ppscount.src	This file contains sets of define names and strings.  Look
		at it if you want to add more or are curious, it's a really
		simple format.

ppscount.perl	This is the perl script that parses ppscount.src and
		generates ppscount.h (actually, sol/ppscount.h).

makefile	The makefile generates ppscount.h from ppscount.src, then
		generates ppscount.o from ppscount.[ch].

ppscount.c	This file contains: init_ppscount(), fini_pps_count(), and
		pps_count().  init_ppscount() should be called during server
		initialization.  fini_pps_count() should be called during
		server shutdown.  pps_count() should be called for every
		event we want to count, using the macros defined in ppscount.h.

Note that this will all work out best if we stick to the transaction steps
as defined in the transcations document.  If we try to combine steps, it
will make it much more difficult to define operations with the granularity
we need to count them.

Programs to test these routines and print the stats are in ~grieggs/src/count.

These routines depend on libmx.a, the Mutex Variable library, which can be
found in ~grieggs/src/libmx.
