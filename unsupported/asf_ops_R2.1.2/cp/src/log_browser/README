log_browser is a X/MOTIF applcation written by Section 363 and donated to
ASF.  I hacked it a bit to get it to work in a generic environment.  It
works pretty well.  When I get a chance, the following changes should be
made:

1) Right now you point it at a single directory, any number of files.  It
cannot traverse directories (it was designed this way).  It should be able
to move around (., ..).

2) The printer environment is a bit of a hack.  It uses a file called
.printer to determine where to send output.  I should use standard
environment variables (PRINTER, LASERPRINTER).

3) msgtest.c is a test program for using syslog() to generate messages.
The scripts TEST and TEST2 will start log_browser to look at the
/usr/adm/messages file.  The other scripts are from 363.

4) To get around some bugs in the SOLARIS version of regular expression, I
am now using the GNU regular expression library.  It seems to work fine.
