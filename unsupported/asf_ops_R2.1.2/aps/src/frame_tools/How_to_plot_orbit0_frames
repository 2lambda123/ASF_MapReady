This is a very quick step-by-step guide to plotting frame points on the
APS mapper.  The source of the frame points may be an orbit0 file (useful
for verifying accuracy of frame longitudes) or a flat file containing
ims data or predicted frames (useful for verifying accuracy of latitudes)

Plotting orbit0 files:

1) You need a database where you can add/delete dtks without disruption.
   You will also need to delete sat_rev_dtkid records.
   You will need to create coverage on this database.

2) Your orbit0 file (or a suitable copy of it) MUST consist of 
   a 52-character header which is ignored.
   900 frame records, which are to be plotted.

   If you wish to plot a phase besides A, modify your orbit0 file so that
   it meets the requirements above.

3) Use the following command to generate nominal coverage (if needed) for the
   first rev in phase.  This matches the rev described in the orbit0 file's
   phase header (eg. for J1 phase A, the rev would be 464)

   aps_rev2time -s J1 -r 464
   1992:073:00:49:40.000  1992:073:02:25:48.740

   aps_crt_nom_cov -Umiguel -Pdappsdev 
	-b1992:073:00:49:40.000 -e1992:073:02:25:48.740 J1 SAR

4) Use the following command to generate dtk records which match the 
   frames you wish to plot:

   miguel_plot_orbit0 -Umiguel -Pdappsdev -p500 -t900 -sJ1 -m SAR 
    /home/aps/r2.1/etc/aps_data/framegen/J1STDFRM.TXT

   This example shows that we are adding 900 frames, and that the
   corresponding datatakes will be stored under rev=500 to rev=508
   (with dtkid=1  to dtkid=99 in each rev)

5) Bring up the APS Mapper and follow these steps to plot both your coverage
   and the corresponding orbit0 frames:
