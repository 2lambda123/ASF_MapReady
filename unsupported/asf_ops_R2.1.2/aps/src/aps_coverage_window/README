    This directory contains the requirements, design, test notes, 
    source code, and makefile for the APS Coverage Window Maintenance 
    (aps_coverage_window) function.  

THROWING YOU A CURVE:  
    There is one more piece to this function, a C-shell script, which 
    is:  .../r1bprime/bin/aps_coverage_window.csh

NOTE:  
    Do not be careless and run aps_coverage_window so that it submits a C-shell 
    script with 30 commands, each running a 180-day 
    aps_create_nominal_coverage run, each taking 8 hours plus.  
    If you do, first see what processes are running, stop the C-shell 
    script, then stop the coverage run.  If you just stop the coverage 
    run, a new one could be started by the still-running script.  


FILE               REMARKS

Requirements.txt   You need to read these notes to learn what this is about.

Design.txt         This tells about how the program was put together.

TestNotes.txt      This tells how to test this function.  It is not very 
                   easy and you will need some tips, which can save you 
                   some time.  

CrontabNotes.txt   A very brief summary of the unix crontab command.

aps_coverage_window.crontab      
                   This file is to be used as an argument to a crontab 
                   command.  It runs aps_coverage_window.csh regularly.  

aps_coverage_window.csh*         
                   This C-shell script sets up environment variables 
                   for aps_coverage_window (by sourcing ~/.apsrc) and then 
                   runs aps_coverage_window.  Its output goes to e-mail.  

aps_coverage_window*             
                   This executable examines the APS database and writes 
                   aps_create_nominal_coverage commands for each sat/sensor
                   to fill the APS operational planning window.  The 
                   commands are written to a C-shell script.  It then 
                   submits it to batch, where standard output is written 
                   to a log file and standard error is written to e-mail.  
                   aps_coverage_window then deletes old data from the 3 
                   relations:
                   cvrg, cvrgmdat, and maskinout.

main.c             This is the main routine for aps_coverage_window.  It 
                   gets arguments from the command line, opens the database, 
                   sets up a log file and then calls aps_coverage_window()

aps_coverage_window.c            
                   Contains aps_coverage_window() and its functions which 
                   do the work.  If you redesign to run from the APS GUI, 
                   you can use this routine; you just provide the arguments.
