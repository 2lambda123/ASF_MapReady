TO BE RUN AT ASF FOR DATA MIGRATION:

MIGRATE1.csh*      Performs first migration steps to be done at ASF.  
                   - Rename dtk to dtk_old
                   - create new dtk relation structure
                   - create new stats_calls relation structure
                   - insert recs from dtk_old to new dtk relation using 
                     defaults for new fields.  
                   ASF DBA or installer may drop the dtk_old relation.  

MIGRATE2.csh*      Performs second migration steps to be done at ASF.
                   runs the executable aps_migrate which places values 
                   into the new dtk fields, using the existing values 
                   of strttime and stoptime in the same record.
                   The executable is run for all dtk records with 
                   revs during and after 35 days before installation date 

MIGRATE3.csh*      Performs third migration steps to be done at ASF.  
                   Runs aps_stats for yesterday going back 30 days; 
                   None of the statistics is reported to IMS, but 
                   records are placed into the stats_calls relation.  
                   The aps_stats run may be now be installed in ASF 
                   operations and run daily and will report only 
                   events taking place after installation.
                   (Before installation, sufficent tracking was not 
                   in place to support accurate statistics reporting.)


Scripts that helped in testing data migration at JPL:

INIT.csh*          For testing:  initializes db to ASF delivery starting point.
