NAME: demIFM

SYNOPSIS:  

demIFM [-offset][-log <file>] <SAR.img> <metadata> <baseline file> <DEM.ext>

DESCRIPTION:

  This program co-registers a DEM to a SAR image.  The starting
  DEM may be in any projection-- demIFM will align a piece of 
  the DEM so it lines up with the SAR image.  You should
  first run the refine_offset program to correct the SAR image's
  geolocations before you run this program.
  
  demIFM generates a simulated slant-range phase image from 
  the DEM (named out_dem_phase.phase), and well-distributed seed 
  points for baseline refinement (in a file named out_dem_seeds).
  
  
  This is useful when running tandem_ifm(1) in two different ways:
  
  	First, the generated seed points are reliable,
  plentiful, and don't have to be hand-picked.  This makes the
  baseline refinement process work well.  To use these
  seed points, just pass "out_dem_seeds" as the "seeds" argument
  to tandem_ifm.
  
  	Second, tandem_ifm will use the simulated phase image to make 
  phase unwrapping easier and more reliable.  Since steep mountain
  slopes are difficult to phase unwrap, tandem_ifm will "flatten"
  the interferometric phase image using this simulated phase image
  before phase unwrapping.  Normally, you'll call
  	> tandem_ifm ... out_dem_seeds -d out_dem_phase
  to do this.
  
  The simulated phase image is already unwrapped (it is not modulo 
  2pi) but contains "holes" (zero values) in layover regions.
  

OPTIONS:
	-offset	   :  option to perform pixel coregistration on simulated
		      images.  
	-log <file>:  option to have the output written to a log file.


    INPUTS:	
	<SAR.img>: A simulated Sar image is created from the DEM, and lined up
	with this image.

	metadata: this is the metadata (.meta file) for the first SAR
	image of the pair.
	
	baseline: this is the interferometric baseline (or an estimate),
	generated by resolve.

	DEM.ext: this is an input DEM image.  It must be a valid LAS image,
	and should cover almost all of the SAR image.  But the DEM need not be 
	aligned with the SAR image-- that's what demIFM is for.

    OUTPUTS:
	out_dem_phase: LAS simulated phase image.  Can be passed to
		tandem_ifm with the -d switch.
	out_dem_seeds: tandem_ifm-compatible seed point file.  Can be
		passed directly to tandem_ifm.


EXAMPLE:

    Let's say we have a SAR amplitude image "e1.img".  Let's say
    e1.img is part of an interferometric pair with baseline "base.00", and
    e1 came from a CEOS image E101234001C0X000.  Let's also say we have
    a USGS DEM, put into the LAS format, named "usgs.dem".  Then we can
    create a simulated phase image and seed point file using demIFM with:

    example1% demIFM e1.img E101234001C0X000 base.00 usgs.dem

	And then we can call tandem_ifm like
    example1% tandem_ifm igram e1 out_dem_seeds -d out_dem_phase.phase
