NAME: register_ccsd

SYNOPSIS: register_ccsd <file 1> <file 2> <igram> 
                     [ <grid resolution> [ <line 1> <line 2> ] ]
  <file 1> an ASF CCSD file (.D or .dat and .L or .ldr)
  <file 2> an ASF CCSD file (.D or .dat and .L or .ldr)
  <igram> the output interferogram (.amp, .phase, .ddr)
  [ <grid resolution> ] is the grid resolution for fico(1).
                           (the default is 20, for a 20x20 grid)
  <line 1>  first line to process for file #1
  <line 2>  first line to process for file #2

DESCRIPTION: 

  Register_ccsd will run the Alaska SAR processor
  on the two images, then coregister the two images
  using resolve, fico, fit_line, and calc_deltas,
  then re-process the second image so that it matches 
  up with (is coregistered with) the first.
  The result will be an inteferogram.
  After this, you can generate a DEM with tandem_ifm.

  The register_ccsd scripts automates the process of sub-pixel
  registration for ASF CCSD data.  This is an acronym for "Computer 
  Compatible Signal Data"-- this script will take this data,
  SAR process it, sub-pixel register it, and make it into
  an interferogram.
  
  After running this script, you can do generate a DEM with
  tandem_ifm(1), or use the interferogram for your own science.

  The input files can be either new format ASF (.D and .L) or
  old format ASF (.dat, .ldr, and .trl).  For very, very old format
  CCSD data, you may need to run fix_ccsd before an acceptable
  image can be obtained.
