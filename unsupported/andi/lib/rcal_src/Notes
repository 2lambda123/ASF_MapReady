Notes on CAL/lib/src

getd and gets are test programs for pulling double or string fields out
of the fourth record of ASF trailer files.  This is important because 
the library functions contained in rcal_ceos.h are designed to do precisely
this task for particular SAR image data parameters and many most of the
important parameters for calibration are to be found in this fourth record
(which is the FRR, or Facility Related Record).  

Usages for the two programs are as follows:

% getd fnm <m> <n>
% gets fnm <m> <n>

where fnm is a trailer file name
<m> = first byte of the fourth record to jump to
<n> = number of bytes to grab 

The n bytes are then interpreted as double or string, respectively to getd
and gets.  By iterative use of these programs, one can isolate data fields 
and then implement the appropriate fields into the rcal_ceos.c parameter-
grabbing functions.
